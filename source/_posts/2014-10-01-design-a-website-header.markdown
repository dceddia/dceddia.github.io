Nearly every site out there on the web has some kind of header. A lot of those are made with an image of some sort. In this post we'll look at a solid technique that can be applied to all sorts of image-based web headers and then go through a few examples of it in use.

### The Technique

Most web headers are wide, but not very tall. In these cases it might be tempting to shrink your content to fit inside the header.

Don't do that. Instead, try leaving your image full size (or even enlarge it) and then crop a really tight area out of it.

Rather than imagining the header as a set of lines you need to stay between, think of it as a small window looking out over a grand scene.
