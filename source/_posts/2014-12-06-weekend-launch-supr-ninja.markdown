This past week, Nathan Barry and Amy Hoy both built and launched products in 24-hours. If you didn't catch it as it was going down, their blog posts chronicling the launches are [here (Nathan)](http://nathanbarry.com/24hours) and [here (Amy)](http://unicornfree.com/2014/24-hour-product-challenge). It was really interesting and inspiring to watch a couple experienced online entrepreneurs launch something so quickly.

So, with that in mind, I'm putting myself to a similar challenge -- to build and launch something by the end of this weekend.

I am going to build a service to help people follow through on their projects, with the goal of getting 5 paying customers, by the end of tomorrow. I figure since Nathan and Amy have launched real products before, but I haven't, I'm going to give myself a few extra hours ;)

I'm using Trello to track what's finished and what still needs to be done. The board is public and you can follow along here:

I'll keep this post updated as I go.

P.S. If you think this is cool, tweet about it! #suprninja

Getting started! I've one cheat working in my favor: I already have the domain registered (.ninja domains were only 99 cents yesterday, and I snagged supr.ninja). Working on filling up the Trello board's To Do section.

DNS should be set up for [supr.ninja](http://supr.ninja), but it will take a little while to propagate. Hopefully not the full 48-hours. I also uploaded the most barebones of barebones placeholder pages so I can tell when DNS has figured itself out. Off to research payment systems.
