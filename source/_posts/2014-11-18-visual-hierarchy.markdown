What is visual hierarchy? And why does it matter? The quick summary is that it describes the organization of elements in a design. And it matters because a properly laid-out design is both easier to understand *and* prettier to look at, which will make your users happier and more likely to stay (and come back!).

Ordering things hierarchically means labeling some of them as more important than others, and that's exactly what's happening with visual hierarchy. You confer importance on an element by making it stand out in some way -- make it bigger, give it a brighter color, or enlarge the font size, for example. These are just a few ways to increase the visual importance of an element in your design.

Since this is *visual* hierarchy, after all, let's look at some examples.

## Examples of Bad Visual Hierarchy

## Examples of Good Visual Hierarchy



- what is visual hierarchy
	- squint or blur page to see hierarchy
- bad examples
- good examples
- an exercise to practice creating hierarchy
	- reorder existing elements? (like kadavy)
	- show a hierarchy, then "make this hierarcy better, post in comments"
