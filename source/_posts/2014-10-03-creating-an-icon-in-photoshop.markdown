I recently started working through Nathan Barry's [Photoshop for Web Design](http://nathanbarry.com/photoshop) course, and it's been a lot of fun. I'll have a full review coming soon, once I finish up, but in the meantime I thought it'd be fun to make a video using some of the stuff I've learned.

If you've used Photoshop's Pen Tool before, you might have found it a bit annoying to use, to say the least. It takes a bit of practice to get proficient at it, and it can be baffling when it doesn't work. Nathan's course inspired me to try making some icons, and I think creating icons can be great pen tool practice.

Check out the video, and follow along!

When you're done, if you want to practice some more, head over to [Font Awesome's icon set](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icons/), pick one, and try to duplicate it yourself. You'll get the hang of the pen tool a lot faster if you're designing something real, and personally, creating an icon seems a lot more fun than tracing out some sort of nondescript practice shape.

Have fun with it!
