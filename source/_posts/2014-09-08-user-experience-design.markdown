User experience design goes hand-in-hand with web design, and if you're trying to broaden your skills as a developer by learning more about web and visual design, user experience design (or UX design) is another topic worth learning about.

A great resource on UX design was posted to Hacker News a few days back, and rather than try to duplicate their 112 hours of curated video content on my blog here, I'll just link you over to it.  It's created by Julia D, a Senior UX Designer at TripIt. I've been happy with the user experience at TripIt, and I can't think of a better person to learn from than someone who does it every day.

The course is appropriately titled [User Experience Design](http://www.mysliderule.com/learning-paths/user-experience-design). I like what I've looked through so far. You do need to sign up for Sliderule (or use your Facebook account), and some of the curated videos require signups. The ones I've run into have been free, though.

Check it out!
