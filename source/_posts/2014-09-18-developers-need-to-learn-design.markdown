You might see the term "unicorn" thrown around from time to time. It refers to a mystical creature -- that is, the perfect combo of developer <em>and</em> designer together in one package. As the story goes, this kind of creature is impossible to find in the wild. You'll hear that developers can't become designers, that they should just hire out the work to a real professional.

I disagree wholeheartedly. As a web developer, you have a unique blend of coding skill and the ability to turn visual design ideas into reality. If you can take a comp from Photoshop and turn it into working HTML and CSS, then make no mistake, you possess this skill.

The missing piece, then, is the ability to design that Photoshop comp in the first place.

For many reasons, it's very important for developers (web and app developers especially) to pick up a working knowledge of design principles. In no particular order, here they are:

<h3>Creativity Fosters Creativity</h3>

Writing code is a creative endeavor. There is a level of craftmanship that goes along with writing code. It requires creative thinking and execution.

Design, as it turns out, is very similar in a lot of ways. It requires intense focus, a desire to sweat the details, and yes, even problem solving skills. All the same things that software requires.

Working on design stimulates the creative parts of your brain. Writing software pulls from this same source of creative energy, when you're trying to figure out how best to refactor some code to make it as clean as possible.

Both of these skill sets draw from and (even more importantly), <em>exercise</em> the same pool of creative energy. Think of your creativity like a muscle. Exercise it by practicing both development and design.

<h3>Work Better in Teams</h3>

If you write software 9-5, you likely work with a designer. And even in the best of times, it can feel like you and the designer aren't speaking the same language.

Learning more about the design process is a great way to make that dialogue easier. You'll be able to converse on the same page, drawing from a similar background of basic principles.

It can help to immerse yourself in the designer culture. Read sites like Designer News, and follow people on Dribbble. The community is different than the group of developers that you normally hang around, but you'll notice a lot of similarities.

<h3>Work Better Alone</h3>

You've probably had this experience with a personal project. I know I have. You've got this great idea that you just <em>know</em> everyone is going to love. You build it up with the newest versions of Rails and AngularJS. Awesome!

But it looks awful. You pull in Bootstrap to try to pretty it up, but it still doesn't look like a professionally-designed product.

Learning more about the "why"s and "how"s behind design will help you overcome this problem. If you're a developer, you probably love finding out how things work "under the covers." Treat design like another one of those things. Learn about spacing, and layout, and colors, and typography, and how they all work together to create a cohesive design.

It will make your products shine.

<h3>New Learning Opportunities</h3>

One of my favorite moments as a developer is when I figure out <em>why</em> something works the way it does. The longer I've gone on thinking it was pure magic, the more satisfying it feels to have that moment of discovery.

Maybe you've noticed that they those moments happen less frequently as you get better at writing software.

There is a treasure trove of those moments to be had in the world of design. There are <em>reasons</em> behind why a certain font is chosen, or why the spacing between a heading and the following paragraph works out to be 80px. It's not pure magic or pure artistic vision.

Not all of design is just picking things that are visually appealing. That's part of it, sure, but designers do use logic and reasoning to make design choices. You can too.

<h3>Keep Your Career Moving Forward</h3>

More and more, software is differentiated from its competitors through things like user experience, visual design, and how it makes users feel.

It's not enough to build in a ton of awesome features that you know everyone will love. They need to be delightful to use.

In order to really make this happen, the developers need to be on the same page as the designers. Doesn't it make sense for you, as a developer, to invest some time learning about how the designer does their job?

As you get better at design, you will have a new selling point to present to potential employers. You'll be able to confidently say that you have worked both sides of the fence, and that you're well-versed in the language of design. Managers will think this is great, because it means less conflict within the team.

<h3>Food For Thought</h3>

I hope this has given you some ideas to think about. As a developer myself, it took me a number of years to realize that pursuing my interest in design was even worthwhile. There is a lot of negative writing on the web about how developers shouldn't try to do design, how they should hire a real designer, and other stuff like that.

To that I say -- of course you can't go from no design experience to grand excellence! But there are plenty of reasons why you should try to learn the trade.

Just try to improve a little bit at a time. It's a journey, not a race. You'll be amazed how quickly it goes.
