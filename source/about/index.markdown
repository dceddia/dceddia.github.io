Hi there! Thanks for visiting design_with_dave.

My name is Dave Ceddia, and I'm a software engineer in the Boston area. I've been developing for the web professionally for a few years, and unprofessionally for many more.

All this time though, I've felt like my designs are rarely any good, and with this blog I've set out to change that. My hope is that by consistently practicing my design skills, I can get closer to the level of a "real" professional designer. And, I hope that by writing about what I'm practicing, I might help a few other developers out there who are in the same boat.

I don't think it'll be all that easy. Learning to write software took a lot of time, and I'm still constantly learning. I don't expect it to be any different with design. But I think it'll be a fun journey, and I hope you'll come along for the ride!

Sign up for my mailing list with the form on the right, and you'll receive weekly exercises to help you get better at web design.

Thanks for reading!
