Welcome!
====

Thanks for signing up, and welcome to our little community here at design_with_dave!

As a thank you, here is my downloadable guide to **Common Design Mistakes and How To Fix Them**:
<br/>
<a href="/guides/common-design-mistakes.pdf" class="get-guide-button">Download The Guide</a>

You can expect to receive a new email from me every week with new exercises, tips, and other things you can do to improve your design skills.

In the mean time, if you haven't read it already I suggest you take a look at my post about [how to practice design](/improve-your-design-skills) and the mindset that will help you make the most progress quickly.

Thanks again, and I hope you enjoy the site! If you ever have a question or a suggestion, email me directly at dave@designwithdave.com or leave a comment. I read every one.
