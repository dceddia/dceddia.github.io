    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There are countless fonts available on the web today. How do you go about choosing one for your design? You can flip through the endless typefaces availabe on <a href="https://www.google.com/fonts">Google Fonts</a> or <a href="www.fontsquirrel.com">Font Squirrel</a> or <a href="www.typekit.com">Typekit</a>, but after a while they all start to look the same. It reminds me of sniffing candles and trying to choose the best one. After about 5 of them, I just can&rsquo;t tell any more.</p>

<p>One of the reasons it&rsquo;s important to think about the font you choose is because fonts have <em>personalities</em>. They imply meaning just by virtue of the way they look, and some of them speak stronger than others. If you match the font&rsquo;s personality with the meaning you&rsquo;re trying to convey, you&rsquo;re golden. But if you do something like this, well&hellip;</p>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper'><img class='caption' src='http://dceddia.github.io/images/posts/2014-09-11-how-to-choose-a-great-font/bedford-police-car.jpg' width='' height='' title='Comic Sans on a police car does not inspire confidence.'><span class='caption-text'>Comic Sans on a police car does not inspire confidence.</span></span></p>

<p>So let&rsquo;s try to work through some examples of fonts that match their content.</p>

<h3>Find a Font for This Text</h3>

<p>We&rsquo;ll start with text and try to match fonts to the feelings they give. Here&rsquo;s the first one:</p>

<blockquote><p>REWARD: $20,000</p></blockquote>


<p>When I wrote this I was imagining a poster from an old Western movie. I&rsquo;m going to open up <a href="https://www.google.com/fonts">Google Fonts</a> and search for a nice font for this text. Why Google Fonts? Well, basically, because it&rsquo;s free. Their selection might not be the best, but I haven&rsquo;t bought a subscription to Typekit yet.</p>

<p>Anyway, Google Fonts has a filter mechanism, so we&rsquo;ll uncheck everything but <strong>Display</strong>. These are the fonts suitable for titles or other small amounts of text &ndash; most of them wouldn&rsquo;t work well for entire paragraphs.</p>

<p><img class="bordered center" src="http://dceddia.github.io/images/posts/2014-09-11-how-to-choose-a-great-font/google-fonts-config.png" title="Choose Display fonts." ></p>

<p>Type in our text into the <strong>Preview Text</strong> box at the top, and just start scrolling until something looks like it fits.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ll probably notice that certain fonts jump out at you as completely <em>wrong</em> for this text. This one looks more suited to the cover of a fancy cat magazine, for instance:</p>

<p class="font-example med" style="font-family: 'Spirax';">REWARD: $20,000</p>


<p>On the other hand, this one might fit the text if you were thinking of a wanted poster from somewhere in the Terminator universe:</p>

<p class="font-example med" style="font-family: 'Audiowide';">REWARD: $20,000</p>


<p>Finally, this one fits what I originally had in mind:</p>

<p class="font-example med" style="font-family: 'Sancreek';">REWARD: $20,000</p>


<p>You can see that it&rsquo;s possible to ascribe completely different meaning to the same text just by changing the font around. This makes typography a really powerful aspect of your designs, and one that you should give careful consideration.</p>

<p>Going through the fonts Google has available, I saw a few others that would fit the mood I wanted for the text. There are often many suitable options, and it&rsquo;s hard to pick the best one. There might be no true winner. But there are usually plenty of obvious losers, like the fancy cat one above, or Comic Sans.</p>

<h3>Find Text for This Font</h3>

<p>Let&rsquo;s try the opposite approach now. We&rsquo;ll take a font and try to write some text that fits with it. This first one is called <span style="font-family: 'Press Start 2P'; font-size: 0.75em; margin-left: 1em;">Press Start 2P</span>. This one reminds me heavily of video games, especially something like Mario. I think something from a video game would fit here&hellip;</p>

<p class="font-example" style="font-family: 'Press Start 2P';">LEVEL UP!</p>


<p>This next one looks pretty obvious too. It&rsquo;s called <span style="font-family: Graduate">Graduate</span>. It reminds me of a poster I saw once with a well-known fellow drinking a beer:</p>

<p class="font-example" style="font-family: 'Graduate';">College</p>


<p>The third one is called <span style="font-family: Flamenco">Flamenco</span>, and this one is more subtle. It didn&rsquo;t call out any particular references in my mind, but it looks like the kind of font that should be used for some kind of pithy saying. I think it benefits from an italic style though.</p>

<p class="font-example med" style="font-family: 'Flamenco'; font-style: italic;">The best things in life are free.</p>


<h3>Go Practice!</h3>

<p>I hope these examples have given you some ideas for ways to get better at choosing great fonts. Like everything else about design, it&rsquo;ll take some practice to get better at it. Have some fun with it!</p>

<p>It useful to have the most common typefaces memorized so when you come upon the question of which font to use for something, you can reach into your bag of frequently used ones. My next post will talk the most common fonts on the web, and how to quickly become familiar with them.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>User experience design goes hand-in-hand with web design, and if you&rsquo;re trying to broaden your skills as a developer by learning more about web and visual design, user experience design (or UX design) is another topic worth learning about.</p>

<p>A great resource on UX design was posted to Hacker News a few days back, and rather than try to duplicate their 112 hours of curated video content on my blog here, I&rsquo;ll just link you over to it.  It&rsquo;s created by Julia D, a Senior UX Designer at TripIt. I&rsquo;ve been happy with the user experience at TripIt, and I can&rsquo;t think of a better person to learn from than someone who does it every day.</p>

<p>The course is appropriately titled <a href="http://www.mysliderule.com/learning-paths/user-experience-design">User Experience Design</a>. I like what I&rsquo;ve looked through so far. You do need to sign up for Sliderule (or use your Facebook account), and some of the curated videos require signups. The ones I&rsquo;ve run into have been free, though.</p>

<p>Check it out!</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Tiny Page Layouts]]></title>
    <link href="http://dceddia.github.io/tiny-page-layouts/"/>
    <updated>2014-09-02T21:17:17-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://dceddia.github.io/tiny-page-layouts</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In today&rsquo;s exercise, we&rsquo;ll draw a bunch of small page layouts. This will help to improve the way you visualize web pages, and break them down into their basic parts. Rather tham spend a lot of time fleshing out the details, like text and other content, we&rsquo;ll just be using basic shapes.</p>

<p>The inspiration for this exercise comes from the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1581805012/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1581805012&linkCode=as2&tag=designwithdav-20&linkId=XVIV2ASG72RURTAR">Design Basics Index</a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=designwithdav-20&l=as2&o=1&a=1581805012" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> by Jim Krause. It&rsquo;s a great resource for learning about design principles. I love how it has a ton of examples that show good versions of designs alongside the bad versions, and it clearly explains what makes the &ldquo;good&rdquo; one better. I&rsquo;ve seen a few places so far where he&rsquo;ll also give multiple iterations of a design, or multiple takes on the same theme.</p>

<p><strong>You will need:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Sheets of paper. 8.5 x 11 will do.</li>
<li>A pencil</li>
<li>An eraser (could even be attached to the aforementioned pencil)</li>
<li>Beverage of choice (optional)</li>
</ul>


<p>Begin by drawing a bunch of rectangular boxes on a piece of paper. Between 10 and 12 is a good number. You can make some of them web-page-shaped if you want, or shaped like tablets or phones. Or just go crazy and make some really tall or wide rectangles. The confined space might make you think of things you otherwise wouldn&rsquo;t have, so it&rsquo;s fun to experiement with some layouts that might not strictly map to a web page or app.</p>

<p>Next, fill those boxes with mini layouts comprised of simple shapes. Squares, circles, triangles, or yet more rectangles. And when I say &ldquo;fill,&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t mean you should literally fill every last bit of space with a shape. Try to recreate some page layouts you&rsquo;ve seen before, or try to mimic a business card layout, or a movie poster. Let your mind wander and come up with unique ways to use the space. Here are some that I came up with:</p>

<p><img src="http://dceddia.github.io/images/posts/2014-09-02-tiny-page-layouts/tiny-layouts.jpg" width="1163" height="1512" title="Tiny Layouts" ></p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t worry about perfection &ndash; you&rsquo;re using a pencil with an eraser for a reason. And even then, the point here isn&rsquo;t to turn out great works, but to exercise the creative parts of your mind to come up with interesting layouts, and begin to think about the composition of objects and empty space in your designs.</p>

<p>If you want more exercises like this one, and a lot of other info on design theory, be sure to check out the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1581805012/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1581805012&linkCode=as2&tag=designwithdav-20&linkId=XVIV2ASG72RURTAR">Design Basics Index</a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=designwithdav-20&l=as2&o=1&a=1581805012" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> book. I&rsquo;m only 100 pages through and I think I&rsquo;m already improving a bit. I should add that if you buy the book through a link from my blog, I&rsquo;ll earn a small commission that&rsquo;ll help me continue writing here in my spare time. So if you do, thanks.</p>

<p>Fill a few pages with these rectangles and mini layouts. At the end of doing a few of these, you&rsquo;ll start to realize you&rsquo;re thinking about things a little differently.</p>

    <link href="http://dceddia.github.io/carbon-copy-google-login-page/"/>
    <updated>2014-08-26T21:49:27-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://dceddia.github.io/carbon-copy-google-login-page</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today we&rsquo;re going to take an existing page and try to duplicate it pixel-for-pixel. The goal of this exercise is to get some experience with building a fully-designed web page down to the last detail, but without having to come up with the design yourself first. This one is pretty long, but I think the experience is worthwhile. If you finish this whole thing yourself, you should feel accomplished.</p>

<p>I purposefully tried to pick a page that was very simple, and one that many people would be familiar with. Without further ado, I give you the Google login page:</p>

<p><img src="http://dceddia.github.io/images/posts/2014-08-26-carbon-copy-google-login-page/original-login-page.png" width="927" height="1149" title="Google Login Page" ></p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s start by copying it on paper, first. Grab a sheet of paper and your favorite pen or pencil and just draw the page as you see it above. Here&rsquo;s my attempt:</p>

<p><img src="http://dceddia.github.io/images/posts/2014-08-26-carbon-copy-google-login-page/sketch.jpg" width="1231" height="1301" title="Login Page Sketch" ></p>

<p>You can see that I&rsquo;m not so great at centering things. Maybe you weren&rsquo;t either. That&rsquo;s ok. The general idea is there, even if the text is off-center and the spacing isn&rsquo;t quite right.</p>

<p>From this sketch, we&rsquo;ll begin building our clone. We&rsquo;re starting from your sketch, instead of from the real site, because it&rsquo;s more like what you&rsquo;ll do during the first pass of your own page designs.</p>

<p>If you already have a workflow that you like to use &ndash; mocking up designs in Photoshop as the first step, for instance &ndash; go ahead and do that. I personally find that sketching on paper is just a faster way to get the ideas out, and the time spent nudging pixels in Photoshop will all need to be done a second time in CSS anyway.</p>

<p>Open up your favorite editor and start off with some boilerplate HTML code. I recommend creating a project directory to house all of the related files, because by the time we&rsquo;re done we&rsquo;ll have at least a couple files.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='html'><span class='line'><span class="cp">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;html&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nt">&lt;head&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nt">&lt;title&gt;</span>Gmail<span class="nt">&lt;/title&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nt">&lt;/head&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nt">&lt;body&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nt">&lt;/body&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;/html&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Save this, try it out, it should be blank. Let&rsquo;s add the initial few lines of content (we&rsquo;ll use text instead of images for now).</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='html'><span class='line'><span class="cp">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;html&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nt">&lt;head&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nt">&lt;title&gt;</span>Gmail<span class="nt">&lt;/title&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nt">&lt;/head&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nt">&lt;body&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nt">&lt;h1&gt;</span>Google<span class="nt">&lt;/h1&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nt">&lt;h2&gt;</span>One account. All of Google<span class="nt">&lt;/h2&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nt">&lt;h3&gt;</span>Sign in to continue to Gmail<span class="nt">&lt;/h3&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nt">&lt;/body&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;/html&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Refresh now, and you should see the text in 3 sizes. It looks pretty terrible so far. We&rsquo;ll get there. Let&rsquo;s add the form now, and since we know it&rsquo;ll need a border around it, we&rsquo;ll stick it inside a div.</p>

<p>Remember, the point of this exercise is to get better at this stuff yourself, not just to copy and paste my version of it. If you&rsquo;re following along at home, you might have something like this now:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
<span class='line-number'>13</span>
<span class='line-number'>14</span>
<span class='line-number'>15</span>
<span class='line-number'>16</span>
<span class='line-number'>17</span>
<span class='line-number'>18</span>
<span class='line-number'>19</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='html'><span class='line'><span class="cp">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;html&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nt">&lt;head&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nt">&lt;title&gt;</span>Gmail<span class="nt">&lt;/title&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nt">&lt;/head&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nt">&lt;body&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nt">&lt;h1&gt;</span>Google<span class="nt">&lt;/h1&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nt">&lt;h2&gt;</span>One account. All of Google<span class="nt">&lt;/h2&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nt">&lt;h3&gt;</span>Sign in to continue to Gmail<span class="nt">&lt;/h3&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nt">&lt;form&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>      <span class="nt">&lt;i&gt;</span>PERSON ICON<span class="nt">&lt;/i&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>      <span class="nt">&lt;p&gt;</span>Your Name Here<span class="nt">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>      <span class="nt">&lt;p&gt;</span>you@gmail.com<span class="nt">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>      <span class="nt">&lt;input</span> <span class="na">type=</span><span class="s">&quot;text&quot;</span> <span class="na">placeholder=</span><span class="s">&quot;Password&quot;</span><span class="nt">/&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>      <span class="nt">&lt;button&gt;</span>Sign in<span class="nt">&lt;/button&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>      <span class="nt">&lt;a&gt;</span>Need help?<span class="nt">&lt;/a&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nt">&lt;/form&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nt">&lt;/body&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;/html&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>At this point, if you refresh, we&rsquo;ve got a mix of inline and block elements with no styling and it looks especially terrible:</p>

<p><img class="center bordered" src="http://dceddia.github.io/images/posts/2014-08-26-carbon-copy-google-login-page/version1.png" width="344" height="350" title="Initial Attempt" ></p>

<p>So let&rsquo;s start to introduce some CSS at this point. Add the import to your <head> tag and let&rsquo;s get working on it. Just come up with some rough styling for now, sizes and the like. Here&rsquo;s the CSS and the result as I have it so far:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

<p>Notice that the &ldquo;Need help?&rdquo; text isn&rsquo;t where it should be. I assumed that the inputs and the text would all be center-aligned, but maybe that&rsquo;s not the best way to go about it. Open up the Chrome Inspector or Firebug, if you prefer Firefox, and take a look at how these elements are laid out. It looks like the way Google did it was to make the inputs 100% width, but put some padding inside the form box:</p>

<p>￼Let&rsquo;s try doing it that way instead. I also collapsed two of the declaration blocks into one.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s fix some of the fonts now. Chrome Inspector/Firebug is your friend here, unless you&rsquo;re already great at visually identifying different fonts. It looks like Google is using Arial for most of the smaller text and Open Sans for the headers. Luckily Open Sans is freely available (from Google, even!). Stick this line inside your <head> tag:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='css'><span class='line'><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nt">link</span> <span class="nt">href</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:300italic,300,400italic,400,600italic,600,700italic,700,800italic,800&quot;</span> <span class="nt">rel</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;stylesheet&quot;</span> <span class="nt">type</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;text/css&quot;</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>As a side note, when I copied that link from TypeCast (<a href="http://typecast.com/preview/google/Open%20Sans">http://typecast.com/preview/google/Open%20Sans</a>), the <code>http:</code> wasn&rsquo;t included, and the font didn&rsquo;t load locally.</p>

<p>Now we can add these two declaration blocks:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='css'><span class='line'><span class="nt">body</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">font-family</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">Arial</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">h1</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="nt">h2</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="nt">h3</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">font-family</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Open Sans&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>It looks a little better already. Now look back at the real Gmail login page, and notice that the font sizes and weights are different. Let&rsquo;s make it look closer to that, again using the Chrome Inspector. The &ldquo;One account&hellip;&rdquo; text is 38px with a weight of 300, and the heading below that is 18px with a weight of 400. Now we&rsquo;ll add this:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='css'><span class='line'><span class="nt">h2</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">font-size</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="m">38px</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">font-weight</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="m">300</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">h3</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">font-size</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="m">18px</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">font-weight</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="m">400</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>That instantly helps it look more like the real page. Let&rsquo;s replace that h1 with the Google logo now. Delete the h1 and put this in its place:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='css'><span class='line'><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nt">img</span> <span class="nt">alt</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;Google&quot;</span> <span class="nt">class</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;logo&quot;</span> <span class="nt">src</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;https://ssl.gstatic.com/accounts/ui/logo_2x.png&quot;</span><span class="o">/&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>It&rsquo;s a huge image though. The Gmail login page scaled it down to 116 x 38px, so let&rsquo;s do that, and center it too.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='css'><span class='line'><span class="nt">img</span><span class="nc">.logo</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">width</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="m">116px</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">height</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="m">38px</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">display</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="k">block</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">margin</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="m">25px</span> <span class="k">auto</span> <span class="m">20px</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>At this point we&rsquo;re also going to reset the margins and padding for everything on the page, so we have more control over styling. We probably should&rsquo;ve done this from the start but let&rsquo;s add it now, and then we&rsquo;ll go fix the spacing. Put this at the very top of your CSS file.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='css'><span class='line'><span class="o">*</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">margin</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="m">0</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">padding</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="m">0</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Both of the headers (h2 and h3) have 15px bottom margins. Add those now. Then the name has a 10px margin above it, and the email has 10px underneath it. We&rsquo;ll want to introduce some CSS classes for those elements now, so we can style them separately.</p>

<p>We can replace the placeholder &ldquo;PERSON ICON&rdquo; text with the real image, too. Copy the source from the Gmail login page. At this point our HTML looks something like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

<p>It&rsquo;s looking pretty good at this point! If you didn&rsquo;t notice the nifty trick they use for the profile image, I&rsquo;ll point it out: that image is actually square, but the border-radius of 50% turns it into a circle using plain old CSS.</p>

<p>Alright, let&rsquo;s flesh out the box. They use #f7f7f7 as the login box background color. The box corners are slightly rounded and there&rsquo;s a drop shadow.</p>

<p>(We removed our 1px dark border). It&rsquo;s getting very close now. Fix the color of the headers to be #555 instead of the harsh solid black, and also they seem to use #404040 instead of black for the rest of their text, so put that in the body block.</p>

<p>One other thing that needs to be adjusted is to bold the user&rsquo;s name and fix the spacing of the name and email address. The use a larger line-height on the email to give it some space, and decrease the font size to only 14px.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s make the password input fancy looking now. In addition to the normal style, theirs also has a hover style, a focus style. Let&rsquo;s start with the normal one.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s tall and the font is a bit bigger at 16px. Then it&rsquo;s got a little bit of padding on the left and right of 8px. Then we need to set box-sizing to &ldquo;border-box&rdquo;, otherwise that extra padding will push the input into the containing box&rsquo;s padding. The border is a single pixel of #d9d9d9, but the top border is one pixel of #c0c0c0 to add a little depth. It&rsquo;s also got a tiny tiny border-radius of 1px. If you A/B your version and the real Gmail login page now, you might notice that it&rsquo;s off by a single pixel, and this is because there is a &ldquo;margin-top: -1px&rdquo; on that password box. Who knows why they added that, but we may as well put it in. Finally, there&rsquo;s a 10px bottom margin to give some space between the password box and the Sign In button. Here&rsquo;s the final declaration:</p>

<p>Now we&rsquo;ll tackle the hover state. For this, it&rsquo;s handy to be able to reliably turn the hover state on so that you can inspect the CSS. In the Chrome Inspector, you want to click this tiny little button:</p>

<p><img class="center bordered" src="http://dceddia.github.io/images/posts/2014-08-26-carbon-copy-google-login-page/chrome-inspector-states.png" width="324" height="120" title="Chrome Inspector States" ></p>

<p>And then check off the :hover box. It looks like hovering changes the border color to be a tad darker, and also adds an inner drop shadow, like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>All that’s left for our password box now is to add the focus state. So check off that :focus box in Chrome’s Inspector and take a look at what changes. It looks to me that the inner drop shadow is still present, but it’s a tiny bit darker (alpha of 0.3 instead of 0.1) and the border changes to blue. They also remove the default blue outline provided by the browser for a cleaner look.</p>

<p>Now we’re done with the password box, let’s do the Sign In button. It has active and hover states in addition to the normal one. Here’s the CSS for the normal state. Did you notice all of these attributes?</p>

<p>The hover state differs by having a slightly darker background and border, as well as a more pronounced text shadow. That text shadow is still very minimal, though.</p>

<p>Finally, the active state is very similar to the hover state, except that it has an inner shadow.</p>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now let’s get the “Need help?” link to look right. It’s a 13px font with a blue color and text-decoration of none. The hover state has an underline:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>After doing this, if you compare with against the original login page you might notice that the “Need help?” link is a couple pixels higher in the original. This baffled me for a little while. Googling for “span space above” clued me in to the reason: inline elements get their line height from their parent element, even if the inline element has a smaller font size specified. One solution is to set the link’s display value to block or inline-block, but I went with the solution of setting the parent element’s font-size to 13px. After looking more closely, it appears Google used 13px as the font-size setting on their body tag, which is why everything renders nicely for them. Lesson learned!</p>

<p>So add “font-size: 13px” to the body, and also add “font-size: 16px” to the name element.</p>

<p>Now we’ll add the “Sign in with a different account” link underneath the form. It’ll start off way off to the left, so we need to center it. I chose to set the display to block and then center the text, but you could also do it with margin: 0 auto. It also needs some size adjustment to 14px. The space above it is actually provided by the form box, which I think is a nice pattern to follow because it means that you could switch out the element below the form without having to change any CSS, and the spacing would remain the same. I just eyeballed it as 20px, since they seem to be using 10px-increments and it looked like about half size of the padding inside the form box, and then double-checked it against the Chrome Inspector. Do the same for the bottom margin (30px). Here was my style declaration for the link (don’t forget to add the border to the form itself):</p>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The “One Google Account for everything Google” text and the array of images below it is what we’ll do next, and it’ll be similar to the link we just did. I used this markup:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='html'><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;p</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">&quot;oneaccount&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>One Google Account for everything Google<span class="nt">&lt;/p&gt;</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The img tag came right from the Gmail login page. Both elements need to be centered, and the p tag needs some space below it. The image has set dimensions, because the source image is twice as big as it needs to be for a non-Retina display. If you’re on a Retina, you might need to double the width and height for the image.</p>

<p>The only thing left to do is the footer. I set it up like this:</p>

<p>On the first pass I tried doing it without the ul, but it was easier to get the correct spacing with it wrapping the links. It’s more semantic that way anyway. Their markup also has all of the content wrapped in another div, but we’ll try to do without that and see how far we get.</p>

<p>The footer needs to stick to the bottom, so it’s absolutely positioned with a bottom of 0. It also has a fixed height and a gray 1px top border. We also need it to stretch the entire width of the window.</p>

<p>You’ll also notice that we need some padding above and to the sides. Floated elements inside will be affected by the padding though, so we set the box-sizing to border-box. And then because of that box-sizing, the top border becomes included in the height, so we needed to increase the height by 1 pixel to make it match the original.</p>

<p>Inside the footer, we’ve got two components: the links, and the language selector. The links are floated left and colored gray, and the list that contains them is shown inline instead of with bullets.</p>

<p>The language selector is floated to the right. While I was trying to get it to look like the original, the select box was positioned too low, and I struggled with getting it to be vertically centered. As it turned out, the trick was to vertically align the image to the top, which had no visual effect on the image but did fix the alignment of the select box. Weird.</p>

<p>I also set the width of the select box to 167px here, even though the original did not define a width, because it seemed like a cleaner way to get the right look without copying Google’s list of supported languages into our HTML.</p>

<p>And with that, our work is done! Compare your work with the original Gmail login page and marvel at the lack of differences.</p>

<p>I hope this Carbon Copy walkthrough has been fun, and motivates you to try your hand at copying other designs out on the web. My goal is to provide you with design practice exercises that’ll increase your skill as well as mine.</p>

<p>This is the first one of these I&rsquo;ve done, and I plan to do more, but I&rsquo;m looking for feedback &ndash; about the length, the number of images, the explanations, everything. Leave a comment below, or just send me an email (<a href="&#x6d;&#x61;&#105;&#x6c;&#116;&#x6f;&#x3a;&#100;&#x61;&#118;&#101;&#x40;&#100;&#x65;&#x73;&#x69;&#103;&#110;&#x77;&#x69;&#x74;&#x68;&#x64;&#97;&#118;&#101;&#x2e;&#x63;&#x6f;&#109;">&#x64;&#97;&#x76;&#x65;&#64;&#x64;&#x65;&#x73;&#105;&#103;&#x6e;&#119;&#x69;&#x74;&#x68;&#100;&#x61;&#x76;&#x65;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#x6d;</a>).

    <link href="http://dceddia.github.io/get-better-page-layout/"/>
    <updated>2014-08-19T23:36:12-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://dceddia.github.io/get-better-page-layout</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One thing that I always find difficult is how to lay out a new web page. Starting with a blank slate is intimidating, and it&rsquo;s tough to know what should go where. You&rsquo;ve got to worry about spacing and navigation and then you&rsquo;re thinking about the pretty header design and the footer and the fonts and the colors&hellip;</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s try to get better at designing pages by starting at a high level with a simple problem to solve.</p>

<p>I want to start with a couple sites that I think are well-designed, or at least nice to look at. Following the idea that you should <a href="http://dceddia.github.io/improve-your-design-skills">duplicate before you innovate</a>, let&rsquo;s take a look at a few examples and break them down into simple blocks.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s MailChimp&rsquo;s pricing page:</p>

<p><img src="http://dceddia.github.io/images/posts/2014-08-14-layout-practice/mailchimp-pricing.png" title="'Mailchimp Pricing'" ></p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s try drawing some rough boxes around the main visual elements here. I did this using the Preview app that&rsquo;s built into OS X &ndash; you can use something fancy like Photoshop if you want, but don&rsquo;t get hung up on tools at this point. I&rsquo;d do this on pen and paper if I could, just to spend more time on the goal of outlining elements rather than aligning pixels. I find, for me at least, using fancy tools makes it too easy to get hung up on little details when I should really be worrying about the big picture. Anyway, here&rsquo;s the MailChimp pricing page with some outlines:</p>

<p><img src="http://dceddia.github.io/images/posts/2014-08-14-layout-practice/mailchimp-pricing-outlined.png" title="'Mailchimp Pricing Outlined'" ></p>

<p>I made the large sections blue and the subsections orange.</p>

<p>A couple things that popped out to me as I was drawing the boxes (hopefully you tried drawing the boxes yourself):</p>

<ul>
<li>The content inside each of the 3 columns is not centered. It&rsquo;s left-aligned. To my eye, this wasn&rsquo;t really obvious by just looking at the original page. Something about those &ldquo;Learn More&rdquo; buttons made me think they should be centered, but when I tried to center the first one in the outlining box, I realized it wasn&rsquo;t actually centered at all.</li>
<li>There is a lot more space below the main header text than above it. That seems to have the effect of separating it from the images below so that your eyes process the 2 sections individually.</li>
<li>The gray background behind the header text extends to about halfway down behind the images. This, along with the lighting in the pictures, gives them a 3D look and makes them pop out of the page.</li>
<li>The menu items along the top (orange boxes) are <em>almost</em> evenly spaced out. Either that means that my boxes aren&rsquo;t evenly drawn (likely) or that some of them needed special treatment &ndash; the &ldquo;Blog&rdquo; link seems to be further spaced out than the rest of its neighbors.</li>
</ul>


<p>Ok, let&rsquo;s look at Google:</p>

<p><img src="http://dceddia.github.io/images/posts/2014-08-14-layout-practice/google.png" title="'Google'" ></p>

<p>This one is very simple and minimalist. There are a few different ways you could carve it up into boxes though. Like this one:</p>

<p><img src="http://dceddia.github.io/images/posts/2014-08-14-layout-practice/google_v1.png" title="'Google Outlined, V1'" ></p>

<p>Or this one, which I think gets the essence across a little better:</p>

<p><img src="http://dceddia.github.io/images/posts/2014-08-14-layout-practice/google_v2.png" title="'Google Outlined, V2'" ></p>

<p>The point here, if there is one, is that there isn&rsquo;t one right way to break a design into its outline pieces, but that it&rsquo;s a useful exercise to go through because it trains your eye to see the larger structures at work in a design.</p>

<p>Your homework, then, is to go and find 5 of your favorite sites and perform this outlining on them. See if you can spot anything unexpected as you&rsquo;re doing it. Try to break a design into boxes in a few different ways to see if you like one over another.</p>

<p>Maybe even go so far as to transfer your outlines to a real piece of paper &ndash; just draw the boxes, and see if the site is still recognizable. I&rsquo;d bet Google and Reddit would be fairly easy to recognize, even as a simple collection of boxes.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m hoping that a bit a practice at this will make it second-nature, and after a little while we&rsquo;ll be able to look at a site and mentally break it up into boxes. Which is a great first step in being able to create your own designs.</p>

    <id>http://dceddia.github.io/improve-your-design-skills</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you’re a software developer, like I am, you may have noticed how apps and websites have become more and more design-heavy over the years. Maybe you’ve thought to yourself, &ldquo;I could do that!&rdquo; After all, you’ve got an eye for good design, right? You can tell the good from the bad. You know to avoid Comic Sans, and not to put solid red text on a solid green background, and that pretty colors and big fonts make everything look great.</p>

<p>Maybe you’ve even tried your hand at imitating the designs you see. It’s hard, though, isn’t it? Your own work never comes out looking as good as something produced by a &ldquo;real&rdquo; designer, and you become disheartened by how difficult it is. You go back to writing code. You’re good at that. It’s what you get paid for. But despite that, there’s still a feeling inside that you could be a designer. You just need to learn.</p>

<p>I’ve been there too. In fact, I still am. That’s why I started this site: to help developers and other technically-minded people learn a thing or two about design &ndash; and while I’m at it, improve my own design skills. Let’s take a look at how we’ll grow together.</p>

<h2>Practice</h2>

<p>Anyone who’s any good at something practices that thing. I’ll say that one more time. Anyone who’s any good at something <strong>practices that thing</strong>.</p>

<p>Guitar players who make it look easy, photographers with thousands of beautiful photos on Flickr, software developers with pristine clean code on Github &ndash; they all practice, whether or not they call it that.</p>

<p>There’s another thing that these people do (or rather, don’t do): they don’t talk about how much they practice. Good photographers don’t post their entire memory card full of photos to Flickr. They don’t talk about how they spent weeks waking up at 5am to catch the perfect light. Instead, they pick the very best images and then post <em>only those perfect specimens</em> online. After they do this for a while, they’ve got a solid body of work and the sheer <em>quantity</em> of it makes it look easy.</p>

<p>Combined, those two things (consistent practice and only publishing their best work) can make that level of success look insurmountable to mere mortals like us. And it probably is, <em>right now</em>. But you will continue to practice and improve. Throughout your journey, never forget this fact: <em>it doesn’t matter how good someone else already is at what you are trying to learn</em>.</p>

<h2>How To Practice Design</h2>

<p>In the case of design, practice takes a similar form to most other pursuits: you must duplicate before you can innovate. We all want to jump into creating something great on our own, but think about it for a second: duplication is how we learned handwriting, how we learn singing, and even how we learned programming.</p>

<p>In learning software development, you follow a bunch of tutorials, maybe type in some code from a book, never building anything original. It takes a while, but eventually the concepts begin to stick. And then you start to work on small practice problems to develop your new skills. At this point there’s no code to copy into your editor, but there’s a problem of limited scope that you can solve by yourself. Tiny problems, that have all been solved before: think Towers of Hanoi, or Reversing a Linked List. After a while of progressively harder small problems, you’re ready to tackle some of your own ideas! Even then, you’re not done learning. You can (and should!) often return to the Duplicating phase, and then the Small Problems phase.</p>

<p>You can use this same strategy for improving your design skills.</p>

<h3>Phase 1: Duplicating</h3>

<p>Find a simple site that has a design you like. Try to recreate it from scratch. HTML, CSS, images, hover actions, everything. Down to the last pixel. If this is too difficult at first, try something smaller: just the login screen from the site, or even just the login form itself.</p>

<p>Work to improve your CSS chops by recreating fancy UI elements that you see in the wild &ndash; like Bootstrap’s inputs with the fancy glowing border.</p>

<h3>Phase 2: Small Problems</h3>

<p>Take on a series of mini design assignments. It’s best if they’re well-defined by someone else, but you could invent them yourself. Just make them something easy and familiar. Think <em>components</em> of a page instead of the page in its entirety. Some examples could be:</p>

<ul>
<li>a login form</li>
<li>a navigation bar</li>
<li>the &ldquo;hero unit&rdquo; / big marketing area at the top of most startups’ sites</li>
</ul>


<p>The goal is to train your creative muscles without becoming overwhelmed with decisions to make. At this point, you’re not duplicating existing designs &ndash; you are putting your own spin on things, but in small doses.</p>

<h3>Phase 3: Your Own Project</h3>

<p>Come up with an idea for a project. Build and design and the site for it. Don’t make it functional. You’re not building a web app here &ndash; even if you want to, eventually. Focus on the design and the HTML/CSS to make it work. If you start coding you’ll get lost in a huge mess of unrelated problems and you won’t learn much about the design aspect.</p>

<h2>Cautions</h2>

<p>Beware of learning something to the 20% level &ndash; until you know it just barely well enough to get something functional and then move on. It’s too easy to fall into this trap with Google and Stack Overflow having all the answers. Pretty soon your projects just become a pile of hacked-together solutions from Stack Overflow and you don’t really understand how it all works, let alone how you’d build it from scratch. It’s really easy to do this with CSS, and you’ll never build the foundational knowledge to solve your own problems if you run to Stack Overflow every single time.</p>

<h2>The Journey Starts Here</h2>

<p>I plan to continue writing here on topics related to design, development, and how to improve your skills. Future articles will expound on the Phases mentioned above, with real concrete examples and walkthroughs of design breakdowns. I hope to see you around! Until then, start practicing those skills.</p>
