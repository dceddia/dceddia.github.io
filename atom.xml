    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This past week, Nathan Barry and Amy Hoy both built and launched products in 24-hours. If you didn&rsquo;t catch it as it was going down, their blog posts chronicling the launches are <a href="http://nathanbarry.com/24hours">here (Nathan)</a> and <a href="http://unicornfree.com/2014/24-hour-product-challenge">here (Amy)</a>. It was really interesting and inspiring to watch a couple experienced online entrepreneurs launch something so quickly.</p>

<p>So, with that in mind, I&rsquo;m putting myself to a similar challenge &ndash; to build and launch something by the end of this weekend.</p>

<p>I am going to build a service to help people follow through on their projects, with the goal of getting 5 paying customers, by the end of tomorrow. I figure since Nathan and Amy have launched real products before, but I haven&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;m going to give myself a few extra hours ;)</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m using Trello to track what&rsquo;s finished and what still needs to be done. The board is public and you can follow along here:
<a href="https://trello.com/b/Za79rfaD/supr-ninja-launch">https://trello.com/b/Za79rfaD/supr-ninja-launch</a></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll keep this post updated as I go.</p>

<p>P.S. If you think this is cool, tweet about it! #suprninja</p>

<p><strong>1:30pm EST</strong><br>
Getting started! I&rsquo;ve one cheat working in my favor: I already have the domain registered (.ninja domains were only 99 cents yesterday, and I snagged supr.ninja). Working on filling up the Trello board&rsquo;s To Do section.</p>

<p><strong>2:10pm EST</strong><br>
DNS should be set up for <a href="http://supr.ninja">supr.ninja</a>, but it will take a little while to propagate. Hopefully not the full 48-hours. I also uploaded the most barebones of barebones placeholder pages so I can tell when DNS has figured itself out. Off to research payment systems.</p>

<p><strong>2:35pm EST</strong><br>
Stripe account is set up, but SSL is required before I can accept payments through my site (DNS isn&rsquo;t resolving yet, either).</p>

<p><strong>3:15pm EST</strong><br>
I set up an account with <a href="https://sslmate.com/">SSLMate</a>, a super awesome service that lets you buy SSL certificates through the command line. It saves a ton of hassle if you&rsquo;re on a Linux server. Next step is to buy the cert. But first, an update&hellip;</p>

<p>I thought I should write a little more about what I&rsquo;m planning to do, too.</p>

<h4>The plan for supr.ninja</h4>

<p>I already mentioned that I want to help people finish projects. So here&rsquo;s why. This has been a struggle of mine for a while &ndash; I start tons of little things, but very few of them are ever really completed. I&rsquo;ve got this Projects folder on my laptop that&rsquo;s just a graveyard of Things That Never Came To Be.</p>

<p>So what I&rsquo;m saying is &ndash; failing to follow through on things is a pain point I understand. And I&rsquo;m guessing that a lot of other people have this problem too.</p>

<p>So, with supr.ninja, the plan is to offer a service that will help keep people motivated. It&rsquo;s a very personalized service, one-on-one, me and you. You sign up for a batch of &ldquo;checkups&rdquo; &ndash; little nuggets of time, where I will contact you however you prefer and spend a couple minutes chatting with you about your project. You tell me how it&rsquo;s going, whether you&rsquo;re making progress, and if there are things you&rsquo;re stuck on. I&rsquo;ll offer whatever advice I can and prod you with a Motivation Stick if it seems like you&rsquo;re giving up.</p>

<p>For contact options, the plan is to offer both <strong>voice</strong> and <strong>text</strong> options. Google Hangouts, Skype, text messages, emails, Twitter, however you want to interact. Each checkup will be a quick, 5-minute call, or a small email exchange. Pricing-wise, I&rsquo;m thinking a voice call will be ~$10 and a text interaction will be ~$3. They can be daily, a few times a week, once a month, whatever you want. You&rsquo;ll pick a slot from the available times and I&rsquo;ll contact you at your chosen time.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m thinking of starting off by accepting a very small group of beta users, 5 to 10. This will keep it manageable and allow me to offer personalized service while learning how this will work.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;ve got any thoughts, feedback, think the idea sucks, whatever &ndash; leave a comment down below or tweet me <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?screen_name=dceddia" class="twitter-mention-button" data-related="dceddia">Tweet to @dceddia</a></p>

<script>!function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0],p=/^http:/.test(d.location)?'http':'https';if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=p+'://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js';fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document, 'script', 'twitter-wjs');</script>


<p><strong>3:55pm EST</strong><br>
Tried to buy an SSL cert, but they do this pesky thing where they want to verify the buyer by sending an email to an email address at the domain. So I had to set up email for supr.ninja, and once that&rsquo;s live (waiting for MX records to propagate), I&rsquo;ll take care of SSL. Also, sent out a mailing to my list (hi guys!). In the meantime, I&rsquo;ll work on sales copy.</p>

<p><strong>6:10pm EST</strong><br>
The first rough draft of the sales copy is live. There&rsquo;s no design yet. It&rsquo;s posted up at <a href="http://supr.ninja">http://supr.ninja</a>. Depending on how well far the DNS changes have made it, you may or may not be able to see it yet. One friend reports that he can see it, but I can&rsquo;t see it myself.</p>

<p>The service is meant to be available in a configurable package. I&rsquo;m not sure how to present this as a buyable thing, though. If you&rsquo;ve got any ideas, let me know.</p>

<p><strong>6:50pm EST</strong><br>
SSL cert has been created and installed. I could start messing around with Stripe now, but instead I&rsquo;m going to work on the sales page design. Definitely more important.</p>

<p><strong>7:40pm EST</strong><br>
Working on the design for the sales page. It&rsquo;s going slower than I hoped, but I&rsquo;m making progress. It&rsquo;s time for a dinner break. Back in a bit!</p>

<p><strong>9:22pm EST</strong><br>
Back to work after a delicious dinner. I got some feedback on the sales copy (thanks guys), made some edits, and now I&rsquo;m back to working on the design. I still can&rsquo;t hit the page from my home network, but I can hit it over 4G, so DNS is at least half-way functional.</p>

<p><strong>1:20am EST</strong><br>
It&rsquo;s been a long day, but a productive one! The design is basically finished, and live on the site right now. There&rsquo;s some more to do for responsiveness, and I&rsquo;ll take care of that tomorrow. For now, it&rsquo;s bedtime. See you all in the morning.</p>

<p><strong>Day 2, 10:30am</strong><br>
I&rsquo;m back at it after some breakfast and a much-needed coffee. I&rsquo;m going to start with making the site more mobile-friendly with some media queries, and then work on finishing up the offer section.</p>

<p><strong>Day 2, 11:20am</strong><br>
The design responds nicely to resizing now. I have guests stopping by shortly, so I&rsquo;m taking a break and I&rsquo;ll be back in a few hours to finish up.</p>

<p><strong>Day 2, 6:00pm</strong><br>
I&rsquo;ve spent the last couple hours working on designing and writing the offer section of the page. You can see what I&rsquo;ve got at <a href="http://supr.ninja,">http://supr.ninja,</a> and let me know what you think. Current plan is to let them pick a contact method, and multiple times, and then I&rsquo;ll just sort it out after they order, manually. I&rsquo;ll revisit later if it becomes a hassle.</p>

<p>Right now, it&rsquo;s time for a dinner break.</p>

<p><strong>Day 2, 8:15pm</strong><br>
I&rsquo;m back at it now, reading up on how to integrate Stripe payments. I was hoping to avoid having to write any server-side code, but it seems like I&rsquo;ll have to do at least a little, to get Stripe working. Only a few hours left though!</p>

<p><strong>Day 2, 12:05am</strong><br>
The page is live, but the payment links are in test mode right now.</p>

    <link href="http://dceddia.github.io/redesign-twitter-app/"/>
    <updated>2014-12-02T00:20:51-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://dceddia.github.io/redesign-twitter-app</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This morning, I saw that <a href="http://nathanbarry.com">Nathan Barry</a> posted a <a href="http://nathanbarry.com/24hours/">24-hour Challenge</a> of sorts &ndash; to create and launch a product, from scratch, in 24 hours. He&rsquo;s making up a set of design exercises and I volunteered to be one of the early supporters and go through some of the exercises and provide feedback.</p>

<p>One of them was to redesign a Twitter clone while restricting the types of changes I could make: only size, position, and contrast. In other words, move stuff around the page but don&rsquo;t change any fonts, add anything new, or take anything away.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>The original version is in black and white (aside from the images, anyway). I should note that this isn&rsquo;t Nathan&rsquo;s original &ndash; I recreated (most of) it in Photoshop so I could change the elements around.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://dceddia.github.io/images/posts/2014-12-02-redesign-twitter-app/bw-twitter-before.png" width="50%" title="Nathan's original version" ></p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s go through some things that make it look less than stellar.</p>

<h3>What&rsquo;s Wrong</h3>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Avatar position</strong> &ndash; The avatar icon for each user is squished up against the left side of the page. There&rsquo;s a tiny 1 or 2 pixel space, but the image feels cramped over there.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Name/tweet alignment</strong> &ndash; The tweet text is indented underneath the person&rsquo;s name, and it makes the layout look unaligned.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Size of name + handle</strong> &ndash; The name and Twitter handle are the same size so they have the same visual weight. I&rsquo;d argue that the name is more important than the handle, though, and that their sizes and/or colors should reflect that.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>All that blank space at the bottom</strong> &ndash; Sorry. That&rsquo;s my fault. Nathan&rsquo;s original had 2 more tweets at the bottom, but I just got lazy duplicating them in Photoshop and gave up at 3.</p></li>
</ul>


<h3>Attempting a Redesign</h3>

<p>I tried to address each of the issues in the redesigned version (well, except the missing tweets).</p>

<div style="text-align: center; overflow: auto; width: 100%; margin-bottom: 2em;">
<span class='caption-wrapper img--before'><img class='caption' src='http://dceddia.github.io/images/posts/2014-12-02-redesign-twitter-app/bw-twitter-before.png' width='' height='' title='Before'><span class='caption-text'>Before</span></span>
<span class='caption-wrapper img--after'><img class='caption' src='http://dceddia.github.io/images/posts/2014-12-02-redesign-twitter-app/bw-twitter-after.png' width='' height='' title='After'><span class='caption-text'>After</span></span>
</div>


<p>Here&rsquo;s what changed:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Text spacing for the tweet body was increased a bit for readability.</p></li>
<li><p>The avatar image was bumped in so to give it some breathing room from that left edge.</p></li>
<li><p>The tweet age was reduced to a middle-gray color, to de-emphasize it, and then it was pulled to the right to make all the ages line up. They&rsquo;re easier to scan this way, since you know they&rsquo;ll be on the right side. In the original version, your eye needs to &ldquo;find&rdquo; the time on each line, because its position varies with the width of the user&rsquo;s name and handle.</p></li>
<li><p>The @handle was moved under the image, and resized much smaller. This created some much-needed whitespace between the user&rsquo;s full name and the tweet age.</p></li>
<li><p>The action icons moved to the right to balance out the composition, and I made them a bit lighter to make it easier to focus on the text of the tweet.</p></li>
<li><p>The user names were toned down a bit, again so it&rsquo;s easier to focus on the tweet.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Looking at it now, there are still a few things I could go back and tweak. And I think my version is an incremental improvement, but not drastically better. But it was a fun exercise! I&rsquo;d recommend giving it a try.</p>

<h3>{ Unnamed product }</h3>

<p>As of this writing, Nathan is still hard at work finishing up his design exercises. From what I&rsquo;ve seen and worked on so far, I think it&rsquo;ll be a great way to get some design practice, and at only a few bucks it&rsquo;s hard to go wrong. <a href="http://nathanbarry.com/24hours/">Check it out</a> if you&rsquo;re looking for some exercises to improve your own designs.</p>

    <link href="http://dceddia.github.io/garage-door-opener-part-2/"/>
    <updated>2014-11-06T23:45:50-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://dceddia.github.io/garage-door-opener-part-2</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last time I wrote, I was working on <a href="http://dceddia.github.io/design-a-garage-door-opener">some rough sketches for a garage door opener</a> I&rsquo;m building for myself. Since then, I&rsquo;ve been working on building the device and recently got some time to work on the web interface.</p>

<!--more-->


<h3>Out with the old&hellip;</h3>

<p>The first couple versions were similar to the drawings I posted last time:</p>

<p><img src="http://dceddia.github.io/images/posts/2014-11-06-garage-door-opener-part-2/old_open.png" width="300" title="OPEN" >
<img src="http://dceddia.github.io/images/posts/2014-11-06-garage-door-opener-part-2/old_closed.png" width="300" title="CLOSED" ></p>

<p>But the design felt kind of&hellip; boring. It was clean and flat, I suppose, but it didn&rsquo;t have any character. And also, the colors were pretty bad, looking back on it.</p>

<p>So I went out in search of some fonts that might spice it up, and in my Googling I stumbled upon a photo of one of those imitation parking space signs. You know the type. &ldquo;WARNING: Get Off My Lawn, You Dirty Kids.&rdquo; Or whatever is fun to put on signs these days.</p>

<p>And a flash of inspriation came to me: I could design the page to look like a road sign! Like the kind you see on a highway telling you about the exit you&rsquo;re about to take by mistake. Like this one:</p>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper center'><img class='caption' src='http://dceddia.github.io/images/posts/2014-11-06-garage-door-opener-part-2/highway-sign-making.jpg' width='' height='' title='You never really grasp the size of a road sign until you're standing on one.'><span class='caption-text'>You never really grasp the size of a road sign until you&rsquo;re standing on one.</span></span></p>

<h3>&hellip;and in with the new</h3>

<p>With the new idea in hand, I went looking for a suitable typeface (&ldquo;road sign font&rdquo;) and found this page: <a href="http://www.fontspace.com/category/highway">http://www.fontspace.com/category/highway</a> &ndash; of the choices there, the one that I liked the best was Roadway. It seemed unmistakably like a road sign to me, even though it&rsquo;s not the typeface actually used on highway signs. Those highway fonts are more about legibility anyway, and this page is going to be sitting 4&#8221; away from my face on a phone screen. Should be fine.</p>

<p>I took the green and yellow colors from signs in Google Images, and armed with Roadway and a frightening amount of time tweaking CSS shadows and border radiuses, came out with these:</p>

<p><img src="http://dceddia.github.io/images/posts/2014-11-06-garage-door-opener-part-2/closed.png" width="250" title="CLOSED" >
<img src="http://dceddia.github.io/images/posts/2014-11-06-garage-door-opener-part-2/opening.png" width="250" title="OPENING" >
<img src="http://dceddia.github.io/images/posts/2014-11-06-garage-door-opener-part-2/open.png" width="250" title="OPEN" >
<img src="http://dceddia.github.io/images/posts/2014-11-06-garage-door-opener-part-2/closing.png" width="250" title="CLOSING" >
<img src="http://dceddia.github.io/images/posts/2014-11-06-garage-door-opener-part-2/stopped.png" width="250" title="STOPPED" >
<img src="http://dceddia.github.io/images/posts/2014-11-06-garage-door-opener-part-2/unknown.png" width="250" title="UNKNOWN" ></p>

<p>Here are a few things I learned along the way with this project.</p>

<h3>Try the Extremes</h3>

<p>One thing I realized is that it&rsquo;s easy to get into a routine of tweaking the thing you have in front of you. Make the box shadow 2px larger, or 1 shade darker. Nudge the title 0.17em down. These little tweaks usually do improve the situation a little bit, but they&rsquo;re not groundbreaking. Nudging some element 2 pixels to the left doesn&rsquo;t make you go &ldquo;Wow, I like this design a LOT better than the last one!&rdquo;</p>

<p>To come up with something radically different, try tweaking things by large amounts instead of tiny amounts. Make something much much darker or lighter, or try doubling the font size. Maybe it&rsquo;ll look ridiculous, but who knows? It&rsquo;s hard to know what your eye will like until you actually <em>see</em> it.</p>

<p>And if you still don&rsquo;t like it, go search for some more inspiration and play around with a totally new design idea. I&rsquo;m much happier with the road sign concept for this garage door page than I ever would&rsquo;ve been tweaking pixels on the first version.</p>

<h3>Side-by-Side</h3>

<p>Looking at all the different variants of a design can bring out aspects that wouldn&rsquo;t appear you were just looking at one image. In this case looking at all of the different door states, each with its own icon and text, made me realise that the word &ldquo;IS&rdquo; looks redundant. Maybe I&rsquo;ll try taking it out and then seeing how it looks in the individual versions.</p>

<h3>Before &amp; After</h3>

<p>Go back and look at the original versions of your design once in a while. I hadn&rsquo;t seen the first version since probably a week ago &ndash; I added Bootstrap, which broke some styling, and I just left it broken as I worked on the code and electronics to open and close the door.</p>

<p>When I checked out the code for that old design today to take these screenshots, I was amazed to see what me-from-last-week thought was a pretty cool design. It&rsquo;s good to review your old work on occasion to see the progress you&rsquo;ve made.</p>

<h3>What Next?</h3>

<p>Even now, looking at the new screenshots, I still want to change things. I&rsquo;m not so sure I want to leave the word &ldquo;IS&rdquo; in there. The &ldquo;CANCEL&rdquo; button should have some icons, or maybe it should be red instead of yellow. I still need to animate the &ldquo;CLOSING&rdquo; state so it matches the fancy &ldquo;OPENING&rdquo; one.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s ok. It&rsquo;s never easy to stop tweaking something and call it &ldquo;good enough,&rdquo; but at some point it&rsquo;s important to move on to the next thing. Which in this case, is wiring up the circuit and installing it on the garage door.</p>

<p>And hitting &lsquo;Publish&rsquo; on this blog post.</p>

    <link href="http://dceddia.github.io/design-a-garage-door-opener/"/>
    <updated>2014-10-22T23:18:10-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://dceddia.github.io/design-a-garage-door-opener</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Remembering to close the garage door is hard. I&rsquo;m now living in the first place where I&rsquo;ve had a garage and I&rsquo;m having a difficult time making a habit of closing the door as I leave. It&rsquo;s a potentially expensive mistake to make, and it&rsquo;s also nerve-wracking being at work later and trying to remember whether I closed the door or not.</p>

<p>So, I&rsquo;m building a garage door sensor + opener/closer device using a Raspberry Pi. It&rsquo;s going to have a web interface, so I thought it would be fun to get some design practice in at the same time.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>Ultimately, I want the device to be able to do a few things:</p>

<ul>
<li>Send me a text message if the door has been open too long</li>
<li>Display whether the door is open or closed, on a web page</li>
<li>Have a way to open or close the door from the web page</li>
<li>Be secure enough that random people on the Internet can&rsquo;t open my garage door</li>
</ul>


<p>In this post, I&rsquo;ll talk about ideas for the web page design and show some sketches I&rsquo;ve come up with.</p>

<p>The next post will detail the creation of the page in HTML and CSS. I&rsquo;ll post the project up on Github when it&rsquo;s all done.</p>

<p>I started by drawing out some sketches of the interface. I would&rsquo;ve used pencil and paper, except I got a drawing tablet recently, so it seemed more fun to use that. Rough, hand-drawn ideas were what I was going for, though.</p>

<p>A lot of these were especially bad. <strong>#1</strong> shows the important info and the action you can take, but it&rsquo;s got no character. It needed an image of some sort.</p>

<p><strong>#2</strong> was my first attempt at a garage door, and some sort of 2-state button. It was here that I realized that the states should be &ldquo;Opened&rdquo; and &ldquo;Closed&rdquo; (not &ldquo;Open&rdquo; and &ldquo;Close&rdquo;) but present-tense doesn&rsquo;t really work as the text for an on/off button.</p>

<p>In <strong>#3</strong>, I just doodled some garages. I&rsquo;m not very good at drawing, as you can see.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://dceddia.github.io/images/posts/2014-10-22-design-a-garage-door-opener/interface-ideas-1.png" title="First Draft" ></p>

<p>I liked <strong>#6</strong> though, and I thought it had more potential than the others. So I took that idea of having an image sandwiched by text and ran with it for the next panel.</p>

<p>With these ones, I played around with different metaphors for the image. A garage door, a lock, a check/warning symbol. At the end of it, I liked the garage with the symbol above it the best, but the other ones were close behind. So hard to decide&hellip;</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://dceddia.github.io/images/posts/2014-10-22-design-a-garage-door-opener/interface-ideas-2.png" title="Second Draft" ></p>

<p>For the third panel, I started with the &ldquo;open&rdquo; version of the lock metaphor (<strong>#13</strong>), and I didn&rsquo;t like it all that much. The open lock has a lot of visual weight on the right, and not very much on the left, and it just feels unbalanced.</p>

<p><strong>#14</strong> and <strong>#15</strong> are a pair where I tried putting all the text above the image, and the button below. I didn&rsquo;t like it quite as much that way, so I didn&rsquo;t replicate it with any of the other images.</p>

<p><strong>#16-18</strong> were playing with the idea of having an access control page and a log of when the door was opened and closed. I like both of those features and I think they&rsquo;re necessary, but I didn&rsquo;t spend much time iterating on different designs for them this time around.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://dceddia.github.io/images/posts/2014-10-22-design-a-garage-door-opener/interface-ideas-3.png" title="Third Draft" ></p>

<p>From all the previous sketches, I took my favorites and drew their open + closed states, and then added a little color for fun.</p>

<p>In <strong>#19</strong> you can see a &ldquo;since 7:04am&rdquo; under the CLOSED state. I thought it might be nice to show some immediately visible info about when the door last changed state.</p>

<p>I also debated between whether the buttons should say &ldquo;Open Now&rdquo; or &ldquo;Open It,&rdquo; and went with the latter. It&rsquo;s not a big deal obviously, but I thought &ldquo;Open It&rdquo; sounded more like a command that you&rsquo;d give a computer.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://dceddia.github.io/images/posts/2014-10-22-design-a-garage-door-opener/favorites.png" title="Favorites" ></p>

<p>So there you have it: my first few passes at designing an interface for a garage door opener. It&rsquo;s been beneficial to start with <a href="http://dceddia.github.io/tiny-page-layouts">tiny rough sketches</a> rather than diving straight into trying to make a web page. Try applying the same technique to your designs and see how it goes!</p>

<p>And of course, if you have any ideas for a garage door opener, please leave a comment. It&rsquo;s a wickedly simple app, but I&rsquo;m sure there are plenty of other directions it could go. I&rsquo;d love to hear yours.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="center" src="http://dceddia.github.io/images/posts/2014-10-14-the-story-matters/book.jpg" title="Book" ></p>

<p>Always start with meaning.</p>

<p>Begin with the intention behind your design and work forward. Don&rsquo;t just add things for the sake of style, at least not early on. Ever notice how designers talking about their work will discuss the story behind it?</p>

<p>They don&rsquo;t say things like how they added in a gradient to make it look more <em>Web 2.0</em>. Or how they added in notched edges to a box just because it looked neat. The gradient is because of an unseen light source. The notched edges make the box look like a ticket to the event being announced.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>It&rsquo;s the stuff of high school English class, the &ldquo;themes&rdquo; behind the work, that give it depth. Personally, I&rsquo;ve always sort of written off this kind of thing as fluffy thinking. In my mind, if the author had wanted to say something, then they should&rsquo;ve just come out and said it. None of this hiding-in-the-shadows-of-meaning business.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve spent most of my life thinking about art and design as something that polishes up or puts a pretty face on something that would otherwise just look bland.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m coming to realize that thinking this way is a mistake.</p>

<p>The trouble is that it doesn&rsquo;t result in a product that has a good &ldquo;why&rdquo; behind it. It&rsquo;s actually <em>harder</em> to come up with ideas for a design if you don&rsquo;t have a story first.</p>

<p>Imagine a painting of a woman who looks sad. It&rsquo;s easy, as the viewer, to look at it and say &ldquo;Ah, it&rsquo;s a picture of a sad girl. Looks nice!&rdquo; And just move on.</p>

<p>But if you asked the artist what inspired the painting, they might talk about how the girl had just lost her father to a year-long battle with cancer. How she&rsquo;s out on a walk through the forest to reflect on all the great times her and her dad had together, especially their weekends camping and hiking. So she pitched a tent, lit a fire, and roasted some marshmallows in his honor. That&rsquo;s why there&rsquo;s a tent in the background, and her father&rsquo;s October birthday is why the trees are colored with the changes of fall.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not because the artist painted a sad girl and then said &ldquo;Gee, this background is pretty boring, maybe I&rsquo;ll add some trees.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Keep this sort of thing in mind as you design. There should be a reason, a <strong>story</strong> behind every line, every gradient, every blurred background. Sure, add some things for visual interest, but don&rsquo;t do it blindly. Do it with the meaning in mind.</p>

<p>Have an intention in mind, and follow through. Your designs will come out better as a result.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I recently started working through Nathan Barry&rsquo;s <a href="http://nathanbarry.com/photoshop">Photoshop for Web Design</a> course, and it&rsquo;s been a lot of fun. I&rsquo;ll have a full review coming soon, once I finish up, but in the meantime I thought it&rsquo;d be fun to make a video using some of the stuff I&rsquo;ve learned.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;ve used Photoshop&rsquo;s Pen Tool before, you might have found it a bit annoying to use, to say the least. It takes a bit of practice to get proficient at it, and it can be baffling when it doesn&rsquo;t work. Nathan&rsquo;s course inspired me to try making some icons, and I think creating icons can be great pen tool practice.</p>

<p>Check out the video, and follow along!</p>

<div class="embed-video-container"><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/a3K8-CjoFFk" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>


<p>When you&rsquo;re done, if you want to practice some more, head over to <a href="http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icons/">Font Awesome&rsquo;s icon set</a>, pick one, and try to duplicate it yourself. You&rsquo;ll get the hang of the pen tool a lot faster if you&rsquo;re designing something real, and personally, creating an icon seems a lot more fun than tracing out some sort of nondescript practice shape.</p>

<p>Have fun with it!</p>

    <link href="http://dceddia.github.io/choosing-colors/"/>
    <updated>2014-09-26T23:02:08-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://dceddia.github.io/choosing-colors</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You may find that it&rsquo;s difficult to choose colors that look great together. You might&rsquo;ve even tried using one of the online color picker tools to help, but it was still hard to get good colors out of it.</p>

<p>Today I&rsquo;m going to talk about the color wheel, how it works, and how to make the most of some helpful color picker tools to choose a great palette of colors that look nice together.</p>

<!--more-->


<h3>The Color Wheel</h3>

<p>It all starts here. The color wheel is a very simple concept with a lot that can be extracted from it.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://dceddia.github.io/images/posts/2014-09-26-choosing-colors/color_wheel.png" title="Color Wheel" ></p>

<p>You might notice that it&rsquo;s a circle. You&rsquo;d be correct! You might also remember from geometry class that a circle can be divided into 360 degrees. The hues shown here are evenly spaced, 30 degrees apart. Let&rsquo;s take a step back and talk about &ldquo;hue&rdquo; for a second.</p>

<h4>Hue</h4>

<p>A color can be defined in many different ways, but here we&rsquo;ll talk about Hue, Saturation, and Value. You might also see this abbreviated HSV (or HSB, where the B is for Brightness).</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hue&rdquo; is just a fancy word for &ldquo;color.&rdquo; You could also get mathematical and say hue is the number of degrees you travel around the color wheel. At 0 degrees, you have red. At 180 degrees, there&rsquo;s green. So hue is a number between 0 and 360 that defines where you are on the color wheel, and it defines your &ldquo;basic color&rdquo;. From there, the basic color can be altered by&hellip;</p>

<h4>Saturation</h4>

<p>The saturation of a color defines how strong it looks. This only really makes sense <em>after</em> we&rsquo;ve already chosen a hue. It&rsquo;s a percentage of the hue. Here&rsquo;s the full saturation range for hue 0, also know as red:</p>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper center'><img class='caption' src='http://dceddia.github.io/images/posts/2014-09-26-choosing-colors/red_hue_range.jpg' width='' height='' title='Range of Red Hues'><span class='caption-text'>Range of Red Hues</span></span></p>

<p>So a high saturation means you get the full color (bright red, in this case). A lower saturation will give you a faint red. 0 saturation is white.</p>

<p>Ok, there&rsquo;s one more term and then we&rsquo;ll get back to the color wheel. That one is &hellip;</p>

<h4>Value (or Brightness)</h4>

<p>These terms are used interchangably, and I like Brightness a little better because it&rsquo;s more descriptive. Fully bright means you see the full color. It&rsquo;s a percentage (like Saturation is). A value of 100% = solid hue (if saturation is at full, anyway). 0 brightness is black, which makes some sense if you think about it. If you turn the light off in your room, it&rsquo;s black, right? No brightness.</p>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper center'><img class='caption' src='http://dceddia.github.io/images/posts/2014-09-26-choosing-colors/red_brightness_range.jpg' width='' height='' title='Range of Red Values (Brightnesses)'><span class='caption-text'>Range of Red Values (Brightnesses)</span></span></p>

<h3>Back to the color wheel</h3>

<p>Ok, so how does all of this apply to the color wheel?</p>

<p>Well, the one I drew is pretty basic. It just has hues, and not many of them, at that. There&rsquo;s no variation in saturation or brightness. For a nice color wheel suitable for actually doing things, check out <a href="http://paletton.com">Paletton</a>. There are other tools like this, for example <a href="https://kuler.adobe.com">Adobe Kuler</a> and <a href="http://colourlovers.com">ColourLOVERS</a>, but I&rsquo;ll just focus on Paletton for now. It looks like this:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://dceddia.github.io/images/posts/2014-09-26-choosing-colors/paletton_annotated.png" title="Paletton" ></p>

<p>Visit the site and try playing around with it. Here are a few things to take note of:</p>

<ul>
<li>The selector up top lets you choose the type of palette and how many colors you can work with.

<ul>
<li>Even though you choose 1, 3, or 4 colors, you&rsquo;ll see that you can choose many different variations within each color (saturation/value). They still work well together because they&rsquo;re the same hue.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Hover over one of the color squares to the right to see its RGB value, great for pasting into your CSS.</li>
<li>The circle up top (pointed to by the black arrow) is the hue selector. Drag it around to pick a different hue.</li>
<li>You can also pick hues by clicking inside one of the outer rings of solid color, the ones that look like Tetris pieces.</li>
<li>The little circles in the middle can be dragged around to change the saturation and value/brightness simultaneously.

<ul>
<li>X axis is Saturation (left/right)</li>
<li>Y axis is Value/Brightness (up/down)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>By changing the Saturation + Value of the base color, you get 4 other similar colors (those 4 other circles in the middle).</li>
<li>Try out the <strong>Fine Tune</strong> button, which lets you change values by small increments and also shows you how the color wheel is affected by each of them (watch the circles move).</li>
</ul>


<p>As a side note: would a video of using Paletton be useful? Should I include a video and text, or just one of them? Let me know in the comments.</p>

<h3>Practice</h3>

<p>Go to Paletton and build a few color palettes that look pleasing to you. Try all of the options at the top-left.</p>

<p>Remember, you don&rsquo;t have to use the full hue for every color. Let&rsquo;s say you picked hue 285, for instance. It would look like this:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://dceddia.github.io/images/posts/2014-09-26-choosing-colors/paletton_285.png" title="Paletton" ></p>

<p>From this page, these are just a few of the palettes that you could come up with:</p>

<div class="palette">
  <div class="block" style="background-color: #998ea8;"></div>
  <div class="block" style="background-color: #99a463;"></div>
  <div class="block" style="background-color: #847445;"></div>
</div>




<div class="palette">
  <div class="block" style="background-color: #321e4c;"></div>
  <div class="block" style="background-color: #e8efc6;"></div>
  <div class="block" style="background-color: #ccbe92;"></div>
</div>




<div class="palette">
  <div class="block" style="background-color: #e8efc6;"></div>
  <div class="block" style="background-color: #998ea8;"></div>
  <div class="block" style="background-color: #f7edcd;"></div>
</div>


<p>So go try creating a few different palettes and get a feel for what works. Paletton also has a handy Examples section (bottom right) that lets you preview the colors in a pseudo-web-page.</p>

<p>Happy color picking!</p>

    <link href="http://dceddia.github.io/how-to-choose-a-great-font/"/>
    <updated>2014-09-15T10:45:34-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://dceddia.github.io/how-to-choose-a-great-font</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There are countless fonts available on the web today. How do you go about choosing one for your design? You can flip through the endless typefaces availabe on <a href="https://www.google.com/fonts">Google Fonts</a> or <a href="http://www.fontsquirrel.com">Font Squirrel</a> or <a href="http://www.typekit.com">Typekit</a>, but after a while they all start to look the same. It reminds me of sniffing candles and trying to choose the best one. After about 5 of them, I just can&rsquo;t tell any more.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>One of the reasons it&rsquo;s important to think about the font you choose is because fonts have <em>personalities</em>. They imply meaning just by virtue of the way they look, and some of them speak stronger than others. If you match the font&rsquo;s personality with the meaning you&rsquo;re trying to convey, you&rsquo;re golden. But if you do something like this, well&hellip;</p>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper'><img class='caption' src='http://dceddia.github.io/images/posts/2014-09-11-how-to-choose-a-great-font/bedford-police-car.jpg' width='' height='' title='Comic Sans on a police car does not inspire confidence.'><span class='caption-text'>Comic Sans on a police car does not inspire confidence.</span></span></p>

<p>So let&rsquo;s try to work through some examples of fonts that match their content.</p>

<h3>Find a Font for This Text</h3>

<p>We&rsquo;ll start with text and try to match fonts to the feelings they give. Here&rsquo;s the first one:</p>

<blockquote><p>REWARD: $20,000</p></blockquote>


<p>When I wrote this I was imagining a poster from an old Western movie. I&rsquo;m going to open up <a href="https://www.google.com/fonts">Google Fonts</a> and search for a nice font for this text. Why Google Fonts? Well, basically, because it&rsquo;s free. Their selection might not be the best, but I haven&rsquo;t bought a subscription to Typekit yet.</p>

<p>Anyway, Google Fonts has a filter mechanism, so we&rsquo;ll uncheck everything but <strong>Display</strong>. These are the fonts suitable for titles or other small amounts of text &ndash; most of them wouldn&rsquo;t work well for entire paragraphs.</p>

<p><img class="bordered center" src="http://dceddia.github.io/images/posts/2014-09-11-how-to-choose-a-great-font/google-fonts-config.png" title="Choose Display fonts." ></p>

<p>Type in our text into the <strong>Preview Text</strong> box at the top, and just start scrolling until something looks like it fits.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ll probably notice that certain fonts jump out at you as completely <em>wrong</em> for this text. This one looks more suited to the cover of a fancy cat magazine, for instance:</p>

<p class="font-example med" style="font-family: 'Spirax';">REWARD: $20,000</p>


<p>On the other hand, this one might fit the text if you were thinking of a wanted poster from somewhere in the Terminator universe:</p>

<p class="font-example med" style="font-family: 'Audiowide';">REWARD: $20,000</p>


<p>Finally, this one fits what I originally had in mind:</p>

<p class="font-example med" style="font-family: 'Sancreek';">REWARD: $20,000</p>


<p>You can see that it&rsquo;s possible to ascribe completely different meaning to the same text just by changing the font around. This makes typography a really powerful aspect of your designs, and one that you should give careful consideration.</p>

<p>Going through the fonts Google has available, I saw a few others that would fit the mood I wanted for the text. There are often many suitable options, and it&rsquo;s hard to pick the best one. There might be no true winner. But there are usually plenty of obvious losers, like the fancy cat one above, or Comic Sans.</p>

<h3>Find Text for This Font</h3>

<p>Let&rsquo;s try the opposite approach now. We&rsquo;ll take a font and try to write some text that fits with it. This first one is called <span style="font-family: 'Press Start 2P'; font-size: 0.75em; margin-left: 1em;">Press Start 2P</span>. This one reminds me heavily of video games, especially something like Mario. I think something from a video game would fit here&hellip;</p>

<p class="font-example" style="font-family: 'Press Start 2P';">LEVEL UP!</p>


<p>This next one looks pretty obvious too. It&rsquo;s called <span style="font-family: Graduate">Graduate</span>. It reminds me of a poster I saw once with a well-known fellow drinking a beer:</p>

<p class="font-example" style="font-family: 'Graduate';">College</p>


<p>The third one is called <span style="font-family: Flamenco">Flamenco</span>, and this one is more subtle. It didn&rsquo;t call out any particular references in my mind, but it looks like the kind of font that should be used for some kind of pithy saying. I think it benefits from an italic style though.</p>

<p class="font-example med" style="font-family: 'Flamenco'; font-style: italic;">The best things in life are free.</p>


<h3>Go Practice!</h3>

<p>I hope these examples have given you some ideas for ways to get better at choosing great fonts. Like everything else about design, it&rsquo;ll take some practice to get better at it. Have some fun with it!</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s useful to have the most common typefaces memorized so when you come upon the question of which font to use for something, you can reach into your bag of frequently used ones.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>User experience design goes hand-in-hand with web design, and if you&rsquo;re trying to broaden your skills as a developer by learning more about web and visual design, user experience design (or UX design) is another topic worth learning about.</p>

<p>A great resource on UX design was posted to Hacker News a few days back, and rather than try to duplicate their 112 hours of curated video content on my blog here, I&rsquo;ll just link you over to it.  It&rsquo;s created by Julia D, a Senior UX Designer at TripIt. I&rsquo;ve been happy with the user experience at TripIt, and I can&rsquo;t think of a better person to learn from than someone who does it every day.</p>

<p>The course is appropriately titled <a href="http://www.mysliderule.com/learning-paths/user-experience-design">User Experience Design</a>. I like what I&rsquo;ve looked through so far. You do need to sign up for Sliderule (or use your Facebook account), and some of the curated videos require signups. The ones I&rsquo;ve run into have been free, though.</p>

    <link href="http://dceddia.github.io/tiny-page-layouts/"/>
    <updated>2014-09-02T21:17:17-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://dceddia.github.io/tiny-page-layouts</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In today&rsquo;s exercise, we&rsquo;ll draw a bunch of small page layouts. This will help to improve the way you visualize web pages, and break them down into their basic parts. Rather tham spend a lot of time fleshing out the details, like text and other content, we&rsquo;ll just be using basic shapes.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>The inspiration for this exercise comes from the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1581805012/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1581805012&linkCode=as2&tag=designwithdav-20&linkId=XVIV2ASG72RURTAR">Design Basics Index</a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=designwithdav-20&l=as2&o=1&a=1581805012" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> by Jim Krause. It&rsquo;s a great resource for learning about design principles. I love how it has a ton of examples that show good versions of designs alongside the bad versions, and it clearly explains what makes the &ldquo;good&rdquo; one better. I&rsquo;ve seen a few places so far where he&rsquo;ll also give multiple iterations of a design, or multiple takes on the same theme.</p>

<p><strong>You will need:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Sheets of paper. 8.5 x 11 will do.</li>
<li>A pencil</li>
<li>An eraser (could even be attached to the aforementioned pencil)</li>
<li>Beverage of choice (optional)</li>
</ul>


<p>Begin by drawing a bunch of rectangular boxes on a piece of paper. Between 10 and 12 is a good number. You can make some of them web-page-shaped if you want, or shaped like tablets or phones. Or just go crazy and make some really tall or wide rectangles. The confined space might make you think of things you otherwise wouldn&rsquo;t have, so it&rsquo;s fun to experiement with some layouts that might not strictly map to a web page or app.</p>

<p>Next, fill those boxes with mini layouts comprised of simple shapes. Squares, circles, triangles, or yet more rectangles. And when I say &ldquo;fill,&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t mean you should literally fill every last bit of space with a shape. Try to recreate some page layouts you&rsquo;ve seen before, or try to mimic a business card layout, or a movie poster. Let your mind wander and come up with unique ways to use the space. Here are some that I came up with:</p>

<p><img src="http://dceddia.github.io/images/posts/2014-09-02-tiny-page-layouts/tiny-layouts.jpg" width="1163" height="1512" title="Tiny Layouts" ></p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t worry about perfection &ndash; you&rsquo;re using a pencil with an eraser for a reason. And even then, the point here isn&rsquo;t to turn out great works, but to exercise the creative parts of your mind to come up with interesting layouts, and begin to think about the composition of objects and empty space in your designs.</p>

<p>If you want more exercises like this one, and a lot of other info on design theory, be sure to check out the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1581805012/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1581805012&linkCode=as2&tag=designwithdav-20&linkId=XVIV2ASG72RURTAR">Design Basics Index</a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=designwithdav-20&l=as2&o=1&a=1581805012" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> book. I&rsquo;m only 100 pages through and I think I&rsquo;m already improving a bit. I should add that if you buy the book through a link from my blog, I&rsquo;ll earn a small commission that&rsquo;ll help me continue writing here in my spare time. So if you do, thanks.</p>

<p>Fill a few pages with these rectangles and mini layouts. At the end of doing a few of these, you&rsquo;ll start to realize you&rsquo;re thinking about things a little differently.</p>

    <link href="http://dceddia.github.io/carbon-copy-google-login-page/"/>
    <updated>2014-08-26T21:49:27-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://dceddia.github.io/carbon-copy-google-login-page</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today we&rsquo;re going to take an existing page and try to duplicate it pixel-for-pixel. The goal of this exercise is to get some experience with building a fully-designed web page down to the last detail, but without having to come up with the design yourself first. This one is pretty long, but I think the experience is worthwhile. If you finish this whole thing yourself, you should feel accomplished.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>I purposefully tried to pick a page that was very simple, and one that many people would be familiar with. Without further ado, I give you the Google login page:</p>

<p><img src="http://dceddia.github.io/images/posts/2014-08-26-carbon-copy-google-login-page/original-login-page.png" width="927" height="1149" title="Google Login Page" ></p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s start by copying it on paper, first. Grab a sheet of paper and your favorite pen or pencil and just draw the page as you see it above. Here&rsquo;s my attempt:</p>

<p><img src="http://dceddia.github.io/images/posts/2014-08-26-carbon-copy-google-login-page/sketch.jpg" width="1231" height="1301" title="Login Page Sketch" ></p>

<p>You can see that I&rsquo;m not so great at centering things. Maybe you weren&rsquo;t either. That&rsquo;s ok. The general idea is there, even if the text is off-center and the spacing isn&rsquo;t quite right.</p>

<p>From this sketch, we&rsquo;ll begin building our clone. We&rsquo;re starting from your sketch, instead of from the real site, because it&rsquo;s more like what you&rsquo;ll do during the first pass of your own page designs.</p>

<p>If you already have a workflow that you like to use &ndash; mocking up designs in Photoshop as the first step, for instance &ndash; go ahead and do that. I personally find that sketching on paper is just a faster way to get the ideas out, and the time spent nudging pixels in Photoshop will all need to be done a second time in CSS anyway.</p>

<p>Open up your favorite editor and start off with some boilerplate HTML code. I recommend creating a project directory to house all of the related files, because by the time we&rsquo;re done we&rsquo;ll have at least a couple files.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='html'><span class='line'><span class="cp">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;html&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nt">&lt;head&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nt">&lt;title&gt;</span>Gmail<span class="nt">&lt;/title&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nt">&lt;/head&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nt">&lt;body&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nt">&lt;/body&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;/html&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Save this, try it out, it should be blank. Let&rsquo;s add the initial few lines of content (we&rsquo;ll use text instead of images for now).</p>

<p>Refresh now, and you should see the text in 3 sizes. It looks pretty terrible so far. We&rsquo;ll get there. Let&rsquo;s add the form now, and since we know it&rsquo;ll need a border around it, we&rsquo;ll stick it inside a div.</p>

<p>Remember, the point of this exercise is to get better at this stuff yourself, not just to copy and paste my version of it. If you&rsquo;re following along at home, you might have something like this now:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>At this point, if you refresh, we&rsquo;ve got a mix of inline and block elements with no styling and it looks especially terrible:</p>

<p><img class="center bordered" src="http://dceddia.github.io/images/posts/2014-08-26-carbon-copy-google-login-page/version1.png" width="344" height="350" title="Initial Attempt" ></p>

<p>So let&rsquo;s start to introduce some CSS at this point. Add the import to your <head> tag and let&rsquo;s get working on it. Just come up with some rough styling for now, sizes and the like. Here&rsquo;s the CSS and the result as I have it so far:</p>

<p>Notice that the &ldquo;Need help?&rdquo; text isn&rsquo;t where it should be. I assumed that the inputs and the text would all be center-aligned, but maybe that&rsquo;s not the best way to go about it. Open up the Chrome Inspector or Firebug, if you prefer Firefox, and take a look at how these elements are laid out. It looks like the way Google did it was to make the inputs 100% width, but put some padding inside the form box:</p>

<p>￼Let&rsquo;s try doing it that way instead. I also collapsed two of the declaration blocks into one.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s fix some of the fonts now. Chrome Inspector/Firebug is your friend here, unless you&rsquo;re already great at visually identifying different fonts. It looks like Google is using Arial for most of the smaller text and Open Sans for the headers. Luckily Open Sans is freely available (from Google, even!). Stick this line inside your <head> tag:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='css'><span class='line'><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nt">link</span> <span class="nt">href</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:300italic,300,400italic,400,600italic,600,700italic,700,800italic,800&quot;</span> <span class="nt">rel</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;stylesheet&quot;</span> <span class="nt">type</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;text/css&quot;</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>As a side note, when I copied that link from TypeCast (<a href="http://typecast.com/preview/google/Open%20Sans">http://typecast.com/preview/google/Open%20Sans</a>), the <code>http:</code> wasn&rsquo;t included, and the font didn&rsquo;t load locally.</p>

<p>Now we can add these two declaration blocks:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='css'><span class='line'><span class="nt">body</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">font-family</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">Arial</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">h1</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="nt">h2</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="nt">h3</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">font-family</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Open Sans&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>It looks a little better already. Now look back at the real Gmail login page, and notice that the font sizes and weights are different. Let&rsquo;s make it look closer to that, again using the Chrome Inspector. The &ldquo;One account&hellip;&rdquo; text is 38px with a weight of 300, and the heading below that is 18px with a weight of 400. Now we&rsquo;ll add this:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='css'><span class='line'><span class="nt">h2</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">font-size</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="m">38px</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">font-weight</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="m">300</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">h3</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">font-size</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="m">18px</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">font-weight</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="m">400</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>That instantly helps it look more like the real page. Let&rsquo;s replace that h1 with the Google logo now. Delete the h1 and put this in its place:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='css'><span class='line'><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nt">img</span> <span class="nt">alt</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;Google&quot;</span> <span class="nt">class</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;logo&quot;</span> <span class="nt">src</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;https://ssl.gstatic.com/accounts/ui/logo_2x.png&quot;</span><span class="o">/&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>It&rsquo;s a huge image though. The Gmail login page scaled it down to 116 x 38px, so let&rsquo;s do that, and center it too.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='css'><span class='line'><span class="nt">img</span><span class="nc">.logo</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">width</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="m">116px</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">height</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="m">38px</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">display</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="k">block</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">margin</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="m">25px</span> <span class="k">auto</span> <span class="m">20px</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>At this point we&rsquo;re also going to reset the margins and padding for everything on the page, so we have more control over styling. We probably should&rsquo;ve done this from the start but let&rsquo;s add it now, and then we&rsquo;ll go fix the spacing. Put this at the very top of your CSS file.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='css'><span class='line'><span class="o">*</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">margin</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="m">0</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">padding</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="m">0</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Both of the headers (h2 and h3) have 15px bottom margins. Add those now. Then the name has a 10px margin above it, and the email has 10px underneath it. We&rsquo;ll want to introduce some CSS classes for those elements now, so we can style them separately.</p>

<p>We can replace the placeholder &ldquo;PERSON ICON&rdquo; text with the real image, too. Copy the source from the Gmail login page. At this point our HTML looks something like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

<p>It&rsquo;s looking pretty good at this point! If you didn&rsquo;t notice the nifty trick they use for the profile image, I&rsquo;ll point it out: that image is actually square, but the border-radius of 50% turns it into a circle using plain old CSS.</p>

<p>Alright, let&rsquo;s flesh out the box. They use #f7f7f7 as the login box background color. The box corners are slightly rounded and there&rsquo;s a drop shadow.</p>

<p>(We removed our 1px dark border). It&rsquo;s getting very close now. Fix the color of the headers to be #555 instead of the harsh solid black, and also they seem to use #404040 instead of black for the rest of their text, so put that in the body block.</p>

<p>One other thing that needs to be adjusted is to bold the user&rsquo;s name and fix the spacing of the name and email address. The use a larger line-height on the email to give it some space, and decrease the font size to only 14px.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s make the password input fancy looking now. In addition to the normal style, theirs also has a hover style, a focus style. Let&rsquo;s start with the normal one.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s tall and the font is a bit bigger at 16px. Then it&rsquo;s got a little bit of padding on the left and right of 8px. Then we need to set box-sizing to &ldquo;border-box&rdquo;, otherwise that extra padding will push the input into the containing box&rsquo;s padding. The border is a single pixel of #d9d9d9, but the top border is one pixel of #c0c0c0 to add a little depth. It&rsquo;s also got a tiny tiny border-radius of 1px. If you A/B your version and the real Gmail login page now, you might notice that it&rsquo;s off by a single pixel, and this is because there is a &ldquo;margin-top: -1px&rdquo; on that password box. Who knows why they added that, but we may as well put it in. Finally, there&rsquo;s a 10px bottom margin to give some space between the password box and the Sign In button. Here&rsquo;s the final declaration:</p>

<p>Now we&rsquo;ll tackle the hover state. For this, it&rsquo;s handy to be able to reliably turn the hover state on so that you can inspect the CSS. In the Chrome Inspector, you want to click this tiny little button:</p>

<p><img class="center bordered" src="http://dceddia.github.io/images/posts/2014-08-26-carbon-copy-google-login-page/chrome-inspector-states.png" width="324" height="120" title="Chrome Inspector States" ></p>

<p>And then check off the :hover box. It looks like hovering changes the border color to be a tad darker, and also adds an inner drop shadow, like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>All that’s left for our password box now is to add the focus state. So check off that :focus box in Chrome’s Inspector and take a look at what changes. It looks to me that the inner drop shadow is still present, but it’s a tiny bit darker (alpha of 0.3 instead of 0.1) and the border changes to blue. They also remove the default blue outline provided by the browser for a cleaner look.</p>

<p>Now we’re done with the password box, let’s do the Sign In button. It has active and hover states in addition to the normal one. Here’s the CSS for the normal state. Did you notice all of these attributes?</p>

<p>The hover state differs by having a slightly darker background and border, as well as a more pronounced text shadow. That text shadow is still very minimal, though.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p>Finally, the active state is very similar to the hover state, except that it has an inner shadow.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now let’s get the “Need help?” link to look right. It’s a 13px font with a blue color and text-decoration of none. The hover state has an underline:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

<span class='line-number'>6</span>

<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='css'><span class='line'><span class="nt">a</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">color</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="m">#427fed</span><span class="p">;</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>After doing this, if you compare with against the original login page you might notice that the “Need help?” link is a couple pixels higher in the original. This baffled me for a little while. Googling for “span space above” clued me in to the reason: inline elements get their line height from their parent element, even if the inline element has a smaller font size specified. One solution is to set the link’s display value to block or inline-block, but I went with the solution of setting the parent element’s font-size to 13px. After looking more closely, it appears Google used 13px as the font-size setting on their body tag, which is why everything renders nicely for them. Lesson learned!</p>

<p>So add “font-size: 13px” to the body, and also add “font-size: 16px” to the name element.</p>

<p>Now we’ll add the “Sign in with a different account” link underneath the form. It’ll start off way off to the left, so we need to center it. I chose to set the display to block and then center the text, but you could also do it with margin: 0 auto. It also needs some size adjustment to 14px. The space above it is actually provided by the form box, which I think is a nice pattern to follow because it means that you could switch out the element below the form without having to change any CSS, and the spacing would remain the same. I just eyeballed it as 20px, since they seem to be using 10px-increments and it looked like about half size of the padding inside the form box, and then double-checked it against the Chrome Inspector. Do the same for the bottom margin (30px). Here was my style declaration for the link (don’t forget to add the border to the form itself):</p>

</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The “One Google Account for everything Google” text and the array of images below it is what we’ll do next, and it’ll be similar to the link we just did. I used this markup:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='html'><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;p</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">&quot;oneaccount&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>One Google Account for everything Google<span class="nt">&lt;/p&gt;</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The img tag came right from the Gmail login page. Both elements need to be centered, and the p tag needs some space below it. The image has set dimensions, because the source image is twice as big as it needs to be for a non-Retina display. If you’re on a Retina, you might need to double the width and height for the image.</p>

<p>The only thing left to do is the footer. I set it up like this:</p>

<p>On the first pass I tried doing it without the ul, but it was easier to get the correct spacing with it wrapping the links. It’s more semantic that way anyway. Their markup also has all of the content wrapped in another div, but we’ll try to do without that and see how far we get.</p>

<p>The footer needs to stick to the bottom, so it’s absolutely positioned with a bottom of 0. It also has a fixed height and a gray 1px top border. We also need it to stretch the entire width of the window.</p>

<p>You’ll also notice that we need some padding above and to the sides. Floated elements inside will be affected by the padding though, so we set the box-sizing to border-box. And then because of that box-sizing, the top border becomes included in the height, so we needed to increase the height by 1 pixel to make it match the original.</p>

<p>Inside the footer, we’ve got two components: the links, and the language selector. The links are floated left and colored gray, and the list that contains them is shown inline instead of with bullets.</p>

<p>The language selector is floated to the right. While I was trying to get it to look like the original, the select box was positioned too low, and I struggled with getting it to be vertically centered. As it turned out, the trick was to vertically align the image to the top, which had no visual effect on the image but did fix the alignment of the select box. Weird.</p>

<p>I also set the width of the select box to 167px here, even though the original did not define a width, because it seemed like a cleaner way to get the right look without copying Google’s list of supported languages into our HTML.</p>

<p>And with that, our work is done! Compare your work with the original Gmail login page and marvel at the lack of differences.</p>

<p>I hope this Carbon Copy walkthrough has been fun, and motivates you to try your hand at copying other designs out on the web. My goal is to provide you with design practice exercises that’ll increase your skill as well as mine.</p>

<p>This is the first one of these I&rsquo;ve done, and I plan to do more, but I&rsquo;m looking for feedback &ndash; about the length, the number of images, the explanations, everything. Leave a comment below, or just send me an email (<a href="&#x6d;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#x3a;&#100;&#x61;&#118;&#x65;&#64;&#x64;&#x65;&#115;&#105;&#103;&#x6e;&#x77;&#105;&#x74;&#104;&#x64;&#x61;&#118;&#x65;&#46;&#x63;&#x6f;&#x6d;">&#100;&#97;&#x76;&#101;&#64;&#x64;&#x65;&#x73;&#x69;&#103;&#110;&#x77;&#105;&#x74;&#104;&#100;&#x61;&#118;&#101;&#x2e;&#x63;&#x6f;&#x6d;</a>). I&rsquo;d love to hear what you think.</p>

    <id>http://dceddia.github.io/get-better-page-layout</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One thing that I always find difficult is how to lay out a new web page. Starting with a blank slate is intimidating, and it&rsquo;s tough to know what should go where. You&rsquo;ve got to worry about spacing and navigation and then you&rsquo;re thinking about the pretty header design and the footer and the fonts and the colors&hellip;</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s try to get better at designing pages by starting at a high level with a simple problem to solve.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>I want to start with a couple sites that I think are well-designed, or at least nice to look at. Following the idea that you should <a href="http://dceddia.github.io/improve-your-design-skills">duplicate before you innovate</a>, let&rsquo;s take a look at a few examples and break them down into simple blocks.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s MailChimp&rsquo;s pricing page:</p>

<p><img src="http://dceddia.github.io/images/posts/2014-08-14-layout-practice/mailchimp-pricing.png" title="'Mailchimp Pricing'" ></p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s try drawing some rough boxes around the main visual elements here. I did this using the Preview app that&rsquo;s built into OS X &ndash; you can use something fancy like Photoshop if you want, but don&rsquo;t get hung up on tools at this point. I&rsquo;d do this on pen and paper if I could, just to spend more time on the goal of outlining elements rather than aligning pixels. I find, for me at least, using fancy tools makes it too easy to get hung up on little details when I should really be worrying about the big picture. Anyway, here&rsquo;s the MailChimp pricing page with some outlines:</p>

<p><img src="http://dceddia.github.io/images/posts/2014-08-14-layout-practice/mailchimp-pricing-outlined.png" title="'Mailchimp Pricing Outlined'" ></p>

<p>I made the large sections blue and the subsections orange.</p>

<p>A couple things that popped out to me as I was drawing the boxes (hopefully you tried drawing the boxes yourself):</p>

<ul>
<li>The content inside each of the 3 columns is not centered. It&rsquo;s left-aligned. To my eye, this wasn&rsquo;t really obvious by just looking at the original page. Something about those &ldquo;Learn More&rdquo; buttons made me think they should be centered, but when I tried to center the first one in the outlining box, I realized it wasn&rsquo;t actually centered at all.</li>
<li>There is a lot more space below the main header text than above it. That seems to have the effect of separating it from the images below so that your eyes process the 2 sections individually.</li>
<li>The gray background behind the header text extends to about halfway down behind the images. This, along with the lighting in the pictures, gives them a 3D look and makes them pop out of the page.</li>
<li>The menu items along the top (orange boxes) are <em>almost</em> evenly spaced out. Either that means that my boxes aren&rsquo;t evenly drawn (likely) or that some of them needed special treatment &ndash; the &ldquo;Blog&rdquo; link seems to be further spaced out than the rest of its neighbors.</li>
</ul>


<p>Ok, let&rsquo;s look at Google:</p>

<p><img src="http://dceddia.github.io/images/posts/2014-08-14-layout-practice/google.png" title="'Google'" ></p>

<p>This one is very simple and minimalist. There are a few different ways you could carve it up into boxes though. Like this one:</p>

<p><img src="http://dceddia.github.io/images/posts/2014-08-14-layout-practice/google_v1.png" title="'Google Outlined, V1'" ></p>

<p>Or this one, which I think gets the essence across a little better:</p>

<p><img src="http://dceddia.github.io/images/posts/2014-08-14-layout-practice/google_v2.png" title="'Google Outlined, V2'" ></p>

<p>The point here, if there is one, is that there isn&rsquo;t one right way to break a design into its outline pieces, but that it&rsquo;s a useful exercise to go through because it trains your eye to see the larger structures at work in a design.</p>

<p>Your homework, then, is to go and find 5 of your favorite sites and perform this outlining on them. See if you can spot anything unexpected as you&rsquo;re doing it. Try to break a design into boxes in a few different ways to see if you like one over another.</p>

<p>Maybe even go so far as to transfer your outlines to a real piece of paper &ndash; just draw the boxes, and see if the site is still recognizable. I&rsquo;d bet Google and Reddit would be fairly easy to recognize, even as a simple collection of boxes.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m hoping that a bit a practice at this will make it second-nature, and after a little while we&rsquo;ll be able to look at a site and mentally break it up into boxes. Which is a great first step in being able to create your own designs.</p>

    <updated>2014-08-11T22:35:15-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://dceddia.github.io/improve-your-design-skills</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you’re a software developer, like I am, you may have noticed how apps and websites have become more and more design-heavy over the years. Maybe you’ve thought to yourself, &ldquo;I could do that!&rdquo; After all, you’ve got an eye for good design, right? You can tell the good from the bad. You know to avoid Comic Sans, and not to put solid red text on a solid green background, and that pretty colors and big fonts make everything look great.</p>

<p>Maybe you’ve even tried your hand at imitating the designs you see. It’s hard, though, isn’t it? Your own work never comes out looking as good as something produced by a &ldquo;real&rdquo; designer, and you become disheartened by how difficult it is. You go back to writing code. You’re good at that. It’s what you get paid for. But despite that, there’s still a feeling inside that you could be a designer. You just need to learn.</p>

<p>I’ve been there too. In fact, I still am. That’s why I started this site: to help developers and other technically-minded people learn a thing or two about design &ndash; and while I’m at it, improve my own design skills. Let’s take a look at how we’ll grow together.</p>

<!--more-->


<h2>Practice</h2>

<p>Anyone who’s any good at something practices that thing. I’ll say that one more time. Anyone who’s any good at something <strong>practices that thing</strong>.</p>

<p>Guitar players who make it look easy, photographers with thousands of beautiful photos on Flickr, software developers with pristine clean code on Github &ndash; they all practice, whether or not they call it that.</p>

<p>There’s another thing that these people do (or rather, don’t do): they don’t talk about how much they practice. Good photographers don’t post their entire memory card full of photos to Flickr. They don’t talk about how they spent weeks waking up at 5am to catch the perfect light. Instead, they pick the very best images and then post <em>only those perfect specimens</em> online. After they do this for a while, they’ve got a solid body of work and the sheer <em>quantity</em> of it makes it look easy.</p>

<p>Combined, those two things (consistent practice and only publishing their best work) can make that level of success look insurmountable to mere mortals like us. And it probably is, <em>right now</em>. But you will continue to practice and improve. Throughout your journey, never forget this fact: <em>it doesn’t matter how good someone else already is at what you are trying to learn</em>.</p>

<h2>How To Practice Design</h2>

<p>In the case of design, practice takes a similar form to most other pursuits: you must duplicate before you can innovate. We all want to jump into creating something great on our own, but think about it for a second: duplication is how we learned handwriting, how we learn singing, and even how we learned programming.</p>

<p>In learning software development, you follow a bunch of tutorials, maybe type in some code from a book, never building anything original. It takes a while, but eventually the concepts begin to stick. And then you start to work on small practice problems to develop your new skills. At this point there’s no code to copy into your editor, but there’s a problem of limited scope that you can solve by yourself. Tiny problems, that have all been solved before: think Towers of Hanoi, or Reversing a Linked List. After a while of progressively harder small problems, you’re ready to tackle some of your own ideas! Even then, you’re not done learning. You can (and should!) often return to the Duplicating phase, and then the Small Problems phase.</p>

<p>You can use this same strategy for improving your design skills.</p>

<h3>Phase 1: Duplicating</h3>

<p>Find a simple site that has a design you like. Try to recreate it from scratch. HTML, CSS, images, hover actions, everything. Down to the last pixel. If this is too difficult at first, try something smaller: just the login screen from the site, or even just the login form itself.</p>

<p>Work to improve your CSS chops by recreating fancy UI elements that you see in the wild &ndash; like Bootstrap’s inputs with the fancy glowing border.</p>

<h3>Phase 2: Small Problems</h3>

<p>Take on a series of mini design assignments. It’s best if they’re well-defined by someone else, but you could invent them yourself. Just make them something easy and familiar. Think <em>components</em> of a page instead of the page in its entirety. Some examples could be:</p>

<ul>
<li>a login form</li>
<li>a navigation bar</li>
<li>the &ldquo;hero unit&rdquo; / big marketing area at the top of most startups’ sites</li>
</ul>


<p>The goal is to train your creative muscles without becoming overwhelmed with decisions to make. At this point, you’re not duplicating existing designs &ndash; you are putting your own spin on things, but in small doses.</p>

<h3>Phase 3: Your Own Project</h3>

<p>Come up with an idea for a project. Build and design and the site for it. Don’t make it functional. You’re not building a web app here &ndash; even if you want to, eventually. Focus on the design and the HTML/CSS to make it work. If you start coding you’ll get lost in a huge mess of unrelated problems and you won’t learn much about the design aspect.</p>

<h2>Cautions</h2>

<p>Beware of learning something to the 20% level &ndash; until you know it just barely well enough to get something functional and then move on. It’s too easy to fall into this trap with Google and Stack Overflow having all the answers. Pretty soon your projects just become a pile of hacked-together solutions from Stack Overflow and you don’t really understand how it all works, let alone how you’d build it from scratch. It’s really easy to do this with CSS, and you’ll never build the foundational knowledge to solve your own problems if you run to Stack Overflow every single time.</p>

<h2>The Journey Starts Here</h2>

<p>I plan to continue writing here on topics related to design, development, and how to improve your skills. Future articles will expound on the Phases mentioned above, with real concrete examples and walkthroughs of design breakdowns. I hope to see you around! Until then, start practicing those skills.</p>
